    "text": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 France is paying tribute Wednesday to French victims of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack, in a national ceremony led by President Emmanuel Macron four months after the deadly assault in Israel that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw around 250 abducted.\n\nThe ceremony will pay homage to 42 French citizens who died in the attack and three hostages still believed to be held by Hamas and other militants in Gaza, Macron\u2019s office said. Four French hostages have been previously released.\n\nPhotographs of the victims will be displayed in the Invalides\u2019 monumental courtyard in central Paris. The Republican Guard\u2019s orchestra will play the \u201cKaddish\u201d by French composer Maurice Ravel, written in 1914 based on a traditional Hebrew melody.\n\nFamilies of victims will attend the ceremony, many coming from Israel on a special flight chartered by the French Republic.\n\nYashay Dan, a relative of French-Israeli hostage Ofer Kalderon, said he hopes the ceremony \u201ccan resonate all around the world, not only in France.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think from this perspective that France is showing a great gesture by being with those that have suffered an enormous blow,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\nAyla Yahalomi Luzon, sister of French-Israeli hostage Ohad Yahalomi, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t need people to hope for us. I have hope. We need help. Ohad is a French citizen and I ask France to make all efforts to release him and everyone.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s speech is expected to address a sharp rise in antisemitic acts in France. Data from the Interior Ministry and the Jewish Community Protection Service watchdog showed that 1,676 antisemitic acts were reported in 2023, compared to 436 the previous year.\n\nThe ceremony also comes after France\u2019s new Foreign Minister St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 made his first trip to the Middle East, including Israel and the Palestinian territories, where he pushed for the release of hostages.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "UN 'Disturbed' Over Pakistan's Clampdown on Ex-PM Khan's Party Ahead of Elections\n\nBy Ayaz Gul February 06, 2024\n\nThe United Nations human rights agency voiced concern Tuesday over Pakistan's crackdown on the opposition party of former Prime Minister Imran Khan ahead of this week's parliamentary election.\n\nElizabeth Throssell, spokesperson for the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, urged Pakistani authorities to ensure the right to participation of all people for an inclusive democratic process.\n\n\"All eligible parties must be able to compete fairly,\" she said during a news briefing in Geneva.\n\n\"We are disturbed, therefore, by the pattern of harassment, arrests and prolonged detentions of leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party and their supporters, which has continued during the election period,\" Throssell said.\n\nIn the months leading to Thursday's vote, PTI has been subjected to a nationwide state clampdown, with hundreds of workers and candidates arrested without charges and released only after quitting the party or withdrawing from the election.\n\nParty officials and local media reported Tuesday that police continued raiding election offices and residences of PTI leaders and workers across Pakistan on the eve of the elections.\n\nKhan, 71, has been in prison since last August after a court found him guilty of graft and sentenced him to three years.\n\nLast week, he was convicted on several highly controversial charges of corruption, leaking state secrets and violating a marriage law. He received prison terms of up to 14 years and was disqualified from holding public office.\n\nKhan and his lawyers rejected the charges and complained that the trials were politically motivated and concluded hastily to demoralize PTI supporters. His legal team has appealed the convictions in higher courts.\n\nThe cricket hero-turned-prime minister was removed from office through an opposition parliamentary vote of no confidence in April 2022.\n\nKhan accuses the military of orchestrating his ouster and maintains the powerful security institution is behind dozens of pending lawsuits against him as punishment for questioning generals' illegal intervention in politics. There has been no response from the military.\n\n\"We expect the higher courts will carefully review these conclusions in line with applicable due process and fair trial rights and Pakistan's wider international human rights obligations,\" Throssell said.\n\nShe also deplored violent acts targeting political parties and candidates ahead of the vote, in which several people were killed and dozens more were wounded.\n\nWith Khan out of the election race, his bitter rival, Nawaz Sharif, a three-time former prime minister, seems to be the top contender for the country's chief executive post.\n\nSharif ended his years of self-imposed exile and returned to Pakistan in October after allegedly striking a deal with the military and has since been absolved of past convictions for corruption. He and the military have been mostly silent on the deal allegations.\n\nOn Tuesday, state media quoted caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar as telling a delegation of foreign election observers that his government had made \"the best possible arrangements\" to ensure a \"peaceful and seamless conduct of elections on polling day across the country.\"\n\nFederal Interior Minister Gohar Ejaz told reporters in Islamabad that, citing security concerns, the government may temporarily disrupt internet service in parts of the country during Thursday's election if provincial or district authorities request it.\n\n\"As of now, no decision has been made. If a request is received from a province or a district, we will assess the threat level in that area,\" Ejaz told reporters in Islamabad. \"Terrorists use WhatsApp for internal communication. If there is terrorist activity, should we not stop communication?\" he asked.\n\nThe minister's remarks prompted human rights defenders to urge Islamabad not to suspend internet service, warning that doing so would damage the credibility of an electoral process already under fire.\n\n\"Pakistan authorities must immediately reverse repressive measures aimed at curtailing journalists' ability to report freely in the lead-up to the February 8 polls,\" Beh Lih Yi, Asia program coordinator at the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists, said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nShe added, \"Blocking critical reporting and hindering access to an open flow of information will only raise more questions about the election, which is already under scrutiny for its legitimacy.\"\n\nAmnesty International pressed Pakistan to \"guarantee interrupted access to the internet and digital communication platforms for everyone across the country.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the vote, authorities have repeatedly suspended internet service and blocked access to major social media platforms nationwide to disrupt PTI virtual assemblies and campaigning.\n\nThe party's official website has been blocked in Pakistan for nearly two weeks, denying voters access to information. Government officials and the state-run Pakistan Telecommunication Authority remain silent on the matter.\n\nThrossell also noted in her statement Tuesday that the parliamentary election \"is a reminder of the barriers faced by women and minority communities in Pakistan, particularly the Ahmadis.\"\n\nThe Muslim-majority nation of about 241 million people declared Ahmadis non-Muslims in 1974. Human rights groups say the legislation encouraged Islamic extremists to attack members of the minority community, their worship places and even graveyards in the years that followed.\n\n\"Separate voter lists \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as is the case for the Ahmadis \u00e2\u20ac\u201d expose them to harassment and violence, despite the equal rights guaranteed to minorities in Pakistan's constitution,\" she said.\n\nThe OHCHR spokesperson also raised concerns regarding the fact that even though 22% of seats in the National Assembly or lower house of parliament are reserved for women, some political parties seem to have failed to meet the legal requirement of having at least 5% women candidates on their party lists.\n\nNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "UNITED NATIONS, Feb 07 (APP): Pakistan Tuesday told a gathering of diplomats and rights advocates at the U.N. that the right of self-determination will not be fulfilled until all peoples who are under foreign occupation or settler-colonialism, especially Palestine and Kashmir, are able to exercise that right.\n\n\u201cThe right of self-determination is bedrock of the modern international system,\u201d Ambassador Munir Akram said, warning that historically a colonial power has never succeeded in suppressing the right of self-determination of a determined people.\n\nAmbassador Akram was speaking at a largely-attended event, which was sponsored by Pakistan, in connection with Kashmir Solidarity Day.\n\nThe topic of discussion was \u201cChallenges to the realization of the Right to Self-Determination in the Contemporary Global Context\u201d, with speakers from all regions of the world upholding that inalienable right pf peoples struggling for freedom.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the Palestinians, the Kashmiris and other oppressed people will ultimately secure their right to self-determination and freedom as most of us have done through the process of decolonization,\u201d the Pakistani envoy said.\n\nPanelists at the Self-determination event were: Ms. Fionnuala NiAolain, a professor at the University of Minnesota and former UN rights expert; Ambassador Maged Abdelaziz, permanent observer of the Arab League at the UN: Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, Chairman of the World Forum for Peace and Justice, and Hameed Ajibaiye, permanent observer for OIC at the UN.\n\nAfter the presentations from the panelists, ambassadors and representatives of Algeria, Turkey, Morocco, Syria, Iran, Venezuela, Eritrea and India participated in the general discussion in which they also raised issues of concern to them.\n\nAmbassador Akram, who opened the debate, highlighted the decades-old Kashmir and Palestine conflicts, warning that these unresolved issues posed a threat to international peace and security.\n\nNoting that the right of self-determination was the fundamental principle of the UN Charter, he said there were still examples of where peoples continue to be denied the right of self determination.\n\n\u201cI will focus on the fact that we face two situations at least, where the right of self-determination is being flagrantly denied:\n\n\u201cOne is Palestine and the second is Jammu and Kashmir in the past four months have illustrated the consequences of the suppression of the right of self-determination to the Palestinian people \u2014 27,000 And counting have been killed mostly women and children,\u201d the Pakistani envoy added.\n\nDespite ICJ ruling and the decisions of the General Assembly, the near unanimity in the Security Council and the support of the international community in public opinion the acceptance of a ceasefire still eludes the international community.\n\nThe Pakistani envoy denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for summarily rejecting the two state solution to resolve the Middle East crisis, and even agreeing to a halt what has been called the plausible genocide campaign in Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe admire South Africa\u2019s reference to the ICJ and we commend Algeria\u2019s initiative in the Security Council to get a ceasefire,\u201d he added.\n\nRegardless of whether or not these were endorsed by the Security Council, he said, under the Charter, they were binding to secure a two state solution.\n\nLikewise, Ambassador Akram said the denial of self-determination to the people of Jammu and Kashmir also deserved the full attention of the international community, pointing out that massive violations of human rights were taking place there.\n\n\u201cAnd the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan is an ever-present threat to international peace and security,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Pakistani envoy warned that the threat of a conflict which has happened in the past, could happen again.\n\n\u201cA conflict between two nuclear-armed states is a sobering thought or should be a sobering thought for the international community,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Monday, he said, the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the people of Pakistan observed the Kashmir Solidarity Day, pointing out that on 5the February, 1989, 100 peaceful Kashmiri demonstrators were killed by Indian occupation forces.\n\n\u201cThis is recorded in two reports of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights issued in 2017 and 2018\u201d, he added.\n\nThe Kashmir tragedy, he said, had intensified after the unilateral measures taken on August 5, 2019 that ended the statehood of Kashmir with India using brutal measures to clamp down on the unrest in besieged Kashmir.\n\n\u201cWith regard to both the situations in Palestine and Kashmir, and I suspect elsewhere, where peoples are oppressed and occupied, a lesson of history has been that colonial power has never succeeded in suppressing the right of self-determination of a people who are determined to sacrifice all for their freedom and liberation from foreign occupation,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks, Hameed Ajibaiye, permanent observer for OIC at the UN, said that the organization always firmly supported the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian and Kashmiri people for the realization of their inalienable right to self-determination.\n\n\u201cThe question of right to self-determination of the people in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir has always been on the agenda of Jammu and Kashmir since its inception,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Ghulam Nabi Fai said that the denial of the Kashmiri people had brought India and Pakistan to the brink of a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nWhile the applicability of the right of self-determination was recognized by the UN, he said it was also upheld by India and Pakistan when the Kashmir dispute was brought before the UN Security Council.\n\n\u201cIt is binding on both governments \u2014 and no allegation of non-performance of any of its provisions by either side can render it inoperative,\u201d Dr. Fai added.\n\nHe highlighted the deteriorating situation in Indian occupied Kashmir, especially after August 5, 2019, and said\n\nthe framework provided by the UNSC resolutions was the only criterion to resolve the longstanding Jammu and Kashmir dispute.\n\nAmbassador Maged Abdelaziz, permanent observer of the Arab League at the UN, said that the Palestinian question was central to the league\u2019s member States.\n\nHe said that the attacks on October 7 were not the beginning of the conflict and did not occur in a vacuum.\n\nDespite Gaza proving to be the bloodiest conflict in recent history, there was still no ceasefire, he said, adding that no peace process could succeed without cessation of hostilities.\n\nThe Turkish delegate reaffirmed her country\u2019s support to Kashmiris in their struggle for self-determination\n\n\u201cAccording to the international convention and the UN Security Council resolutions, no unilateral steps should be taken to alter the situation. Yet the issue became all the more complicated after India\u2019s unilateral decision to revoke Article 370.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish diplomat also highlighted the need for the \u201cpreservation of ethnic and demographic structure of the region\u201d as \u201ca key element of the resolution of this (IIJK) long-standing issue.\u201d\n\nMs. NiAolain, a former UN rights expert, termed self-determination as a gateway for the fulfillment of all other rights.\n\n\u201cSelf-determination is bed-rock of international system and essential for human development,\u201d she said.\n\nThe participants also heard a diatribe against Pakistan from the Indian delegate, Suman Sonkar, who stuck up the same old tune that Kashmir was an integral part of India and accusing Pakistan of involvement in terrorism while questioning its record on minorities\u2019 rights.\n\nAmbassador Akram hit back, saying the Indian delegate comments were out the framework of the discussion, while rejecting her allegations. He also pointed out the \u201ccommunality\u201d of India\u2019s position with that of Israel\u2013 both countries denying the right of self-determination to the people of Kashmir and Palestine, respectively.\n\nDr. Fai, who hails from Indian occupied Kashmir, also called the Indian delegate\u2019s remarks irrelevant and misleading.\n\nWhat is relevant are the UN Security Council resolutions calling for a plebiscite in Kashmir and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 statement of Aug. 8, 2019, he said.\n\nThe UN chief then said, \u201cThe position of the United Nations on this region (Jammu and Kashmir) is governed by the Charter of the United Nations and applicable Security Council resolutions.\u201d\n\nAPP/ift"

    "text": "In the last two and a half years after regaining power in Afghanistan, the Taliban, have created the world\u2019s most serious women\u2019s rights crisis. They have systematically violated the rights of women and girls including as they relate to education, paid employment, freedom of speech and movement, and political participation among many others. The response of the international community has been tepid and seems to lack an appreciation of how the situation in Afghanistan has grave implications for the rights of women and girls globally. More needs to be done to prevent this from developing any further and to reinforce global commitment to gender equality.\n\n\n\nThe crisis in Afghanistan has largely disappeared from the news. It was pushed aside by the war in Ukraine and the humiliation and fatigue of Western countries whose twenty years of military and civilian intervention ended in dust and defeat. As a new war unfolds in the Middle East, Afghans do not have the option to just move on and forget\u2014for women and girls in particular, life under the Taliban involves ever-deepening misery.\n\n\n\nIn the more than two years since seizing control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban have carried out a relentless and all-encompassing attack on the human rights of women and girls, violating virtually every aspect of these rights.\n\n\n\nAfghan women are putting their lives on the line\u2014facing surveillance, harassment, assault, arbitrary detention, torture, and exile\u2014to oppose Taliban abuses. They deserve the international community\u2019s full solidarity in their struggle. But the world should also stand with them because the events in Afghanistan\u2014and the world\u2019s response\u2014have deep implications for gender equality everywhere.\n\n\n\nAt A Glance: \u201cGender Apartheid\u201d in the Taliban\u2019s Afghanistan\n\n\n\nThere is broad consensus that the situation in Afghanistan is the most serious women\u2019s rights crisis in the world. The country is ranked last on the Women, Peace and Security Index and the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Afghanistan has referred to \u201cthe unprecedented deterioration of women\u2019s rights.\u201d Afghan women\u2014and officials at the UN and elsewhere\u2014have called it \u201cgender apartheid.\u201d Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 75 years ago, there may never have been anything like it\u2014except once, from 1996 to 2001 when the Taliban previously controlled Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nRecent Taliban crackdowns on women\u2019s employment in the private sector, including ordering the closure of all beauty salons at a cost of 60,000 women\u2019s jobs, signal a continuing assault on the livelihood of Afghan women. The closure of beauty salons also signifies the loss of one of the very few women-only spaces outside the home\u2014a crucial source of community and support, especially given that the Taliban systematically dismantled services for women and girls experiencing domestic violence.\n\n\n\nTheir ban on women working in most roles in aid agencies is putting more women and girls in crisis. In Afghanistan\u2019s increasingly gender-segregated society, if women workers are not there to deliver aid to women, they will often go without aid. Beyond blocking basic access to food at risk, even the chance to walk in a park, play a sport, or enjoy nature is being stripped away from Afghanistan\u2019s women and girls.\n\n\n\nWomen who protest these violations face terrible consequences including enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, and torture. From threats, beatings, and abusive conditions both during detainment and release, the Taliban continue to commit severe abuses against an ongoing\u2014and underreported\u2014string of women\u2019s rights defenders. More recently they have also begun widespread detaining of women and girls on accusations that they were not wearing \u201cproper hijab.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfghanistan today faces a constant flow of new restrictions against women and girls\u2014and the Taliban are nowhere near done with their dystopian project.\n\n\n\nUn-Feminist Foreign Policy\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the International Commission of Jurists, and have all adopted the position that the Taliban have committed crimes against humanity of gender persecution, which fall within the jurisdiction of national and international courts including the International Criminal Court (ICC).\n\n\n\nThe response of governments and international organizations to this crisis, though, has been poor. It has been disorganized, politicized, chaotic, often apathetic, and, frankly, un-feminist. Many diplomats tell us how important it is to \u201cengage\u201d with the Taliban. But it is very clear by now that that engagement has produced nothing in terms of convincing the Taliban to end their assault on women\u2019s rights\u2014and may even be counterproductive. When diplomats \u201cengage,\u201d the focus is often on counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, business deals, or hostage returns. Despite Afghan women signaling and appealing otherwise, their rights protection agenda rarely makes it onto the priority list of diplomats.\n\n\n\nThere has also been unhelpful global rhetoric suggesting that the international community faces a mutually exclusive choice between defending women\u2019s rights and saving lives through humanitarian assistance \u2013 many prioritizing the latter only. However, fully respecting women\u2019s rights is essential to the project of saving lives through humanitarian assistance.\n\n\n\nThe fact that over 90 percent of the more than 2,000 people killed in the October 2023 Herat earthquakes were women and children is a stark reminder of this. The earthquake struck in late morning, at an hour when men were out at work and women were at home minding children\u2014the only role the Taliban feel they ought to have. Rights violations under the Taliban have also contributed to higher rates of hunger among women-headed households \u2013 another indicator of why more needs to be done.\n\n\n\nIf the world can learn to live with the Taliban\u2019s abuses\u2014Afghan women being largely confined to their homes, losing their voice, their personhood, their education, their dreams, and contributions to their communities\u2014then this is a brutal demonstration of how fragile the rights of women and girls are everywhere.\n\n\n\nIf Taliban leaders can fly on private jets, be rolled the red carpet on diplomatic visits, allowed to run embassies, and be courted for business deals\u2014while continuing to enact the most comprehensive set of women\u2019s rights violations on the planet\u2014this is a clear sign of how little women\u2019s rights, anywhere, matter.\n\n\n\nConsequences Far Beyond Afghanistan\n\n\n\nBeyond Afghanistan, communities face a global backlash and repressive developments against the rights of women and girls. From attacks on reproductive rights and sexual violence against women and girls during conflicts, to the gendered impacts of climate change, women\u2019s rights all over the world remain in crisis.\n\n\n\nNo country has achieved gender equality. Women in Iceland, long seen as the world\u2019s most equal country, recently went on strike, protesting stalled progress toward gender equality. In Iran, women and their male allies have been jailed and killed for protesting forced hijab-wearing and other forms of discrimination. Women\u2019s participation in peace processes is , even in UN-supported talks.\n\n\n\nTechnological advances are fueling new forms of gender-based violence including against female journalists and politicians with serious and even deadly consequences. UN Women says gender disparities are worsening and it could take another to close the global gender gaps in legal protections for women and girls. In countries with declining birth rates, governments are often pursuing strategies that harm women.\n\n\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s attacks on the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan\u2014and the tepid international response to this crisis\u2014are happening within this context. The global backlash perhaps feels like permission for diplomats to shrug their shoulders in a \u201cwhat can you do?\u201d way over the women\u2019s rights crisis in Afghanistan. One effect of the Taliban\u2019s abuses is that the bar for women\u2019s rights globally just got much lower. The lack of an effective international response creates the impression that women\u2019s rights are not much of a concern to world leaders.\n\n\n\nExperts and activists in other countries have pointed to \u201cTalibanization,\u201d where the success of the Taliban appears to be emboldening misogynistic leaders everywhere. In Yemen, for instance, Houthi leaders have imposed similar restrictions. Boko Haram is sometimes referred to as the Taliban of Nigeria and elsewhere the Taliban have been described as \u201cthe world\u2019s most successful terrorist group.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Way Forward?\n\n\n\nSo, what should the international community do to stand with Afghan women and, in doing so, defend women\u2019s rights everywhere? Rights advocates must tell political leaders that they have not forgotten the women\u2019s crisis in Afghanistan, and leaders are not allowed to either. Specific steps within multilateral organizations must be taken.\n\n\n\nAt the United Nations (UN) level, leaders should support efforts to adopt a treaty on crimes against humanity that would strengthen protections for women and explore the inclusion of \u201cgender apartheid.\u201d There is also a need for the creation of a UN-mandated accountability mechanism to collect and preserve evidence of international crimes being committed in Afghanistan, including against women and girls. Delegates should support the special rapporteur and other experts on human rights in Afghanistan as they prepare to report to the Human Rights Council in June 2024 on a response to the Taliban\u2019s \u201cinstitutionalized system of discrimination, segregation, disrespect for human dignity and exclusion of women and girls.\u201d\n\n\n\nFinally, discussions should call for the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan while maintaining its current responsibility to monitor the human rights situation with adequate staffing.\n\n\n\nAs for international courts, political leaders should ensure that the ICC and other courts have the resources and cooperation needed to hold Taliban leaders accountable for gender persecution. A case must also be brought to the International Court of Justice regarding the Taliban\u2019s violations of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which Afghanistan ratified without reservation in 2003.\n\n\n\nAs a well-known saying from Indigenous women activists in Australia goes, \u201cIf you have come to help me, you are wasting your time. If you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us walk together.\u201d The international community should recognize that the fight Afghan women and girls are in right now is a fight for the rights of women and girls everywhere. We should stand with them as if their fate helps determine our own\u2014because it does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nClick for original article\n\n\n\n...... read full story"

A VOA reporter said other workers and customers in the market were among the deceased.\n\nAuthorities in Mogadishu said the explosions were caused by devices planted in the stores.\n\n\"There is an investigation ongoing, security agencies are busy working on it and will update later,\" said Mohamed Ahmed Diriye, the deputy mayor of Mogadishu for security and policy.\n\nAuthorities did not disclose the motive of the attacks against the businesses, but a security officer who did not want to be named because he is not allowed to speak to the media, told VOA Somali that the attacks are related to the installation of CCTV cameras by the businesses.\n\nLast year, Somalia's security agencies urged the businesses to install security cameras.\n\nSome of the store owners said they later received anonymous calls from people claiming to be from al-Shabab, who warned them against the installations. The militants reportedly feared the cameras would help security branches identify al-Shabab members.\n\nSomali security agencies have recorded incidents of al-Shabab militants intimidating businesses as part of an extortion campaign.\n\nThe United States has reported that al-Shabab generates an estimated $100 million annually that is collected through illicit taxations, mandatory donations and extortions.\n\nThe Somali government last year claimed al-Shabab's revenues have been cut in half following the implementation of security measures, including the shutting down of suspected bank and mobile money accounts, and targeting militants taxation officials.\n\nNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "At least 26 people were killed while over 30 suffered injuries after back-to-back blasts hit Balochistan\u2019s Pishin and Qila Saifullah on Wednesday, officials said.\n\nThe incidents came a day before general elections are scheduled to be held in the country. Pakistan has recently witnessed an uptick in terrorism, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, raising security concerns.\n\nThe first blast occurred in Pishin\u2019s Khanozai union council, situated at an hour\u2019s distance from Quetta, a little after noon.\n\nThe district\u2019s deputy commissioner, Jumma Dad Mandokhail, told Dawn.com that the incident occurred outside the election office of independent candidate Asfandyar Kakar, who is contesting polls from PB-47 (Pishin 1).\n\nAt least 14 people were killed and more than 23 were injured, he said.\n\nDC Mandokhail said the bodies and the wounded were moved to Quetta Civil Hospital. The condition of four of the injured people was critical, he added.\n\nThe official said the explosive material was planted in a motorcycle parked in the area. The police, bomb disposal squad and other law enforcement agencies immediately cordoned off the area and began collecting evidence, the DC added.\n\nThe second blast was reported in Qila Saifullah shortly after. According to Deputy Commissioner Yasir Bazai, 12 people lost their lives and 14 were wounded in the incident, which took place outside the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) election office.\n\nHe added that critical persons were being moved to Quetta via a helicopter.\n\nECP takes notice\n\nIn separate statements, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) took notice of the blasts and summoned reports from the Balochistan chief secretary and the provincial police chief.\n\nInterim Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Ali Mardan Domki also took notice of the incident and sought a report from the provincial interior ministry. Expressing grief over the loss of lives, he directed the officials concerned to utilise all available resources to arrest the culprits.\n\nCM Domki said the attacks were an \u201cattempt to sabotage the process of peaceful elections\u201d and asserted that all resources were being out to use to \u201cprovide complete protection to the public\u201d.\n\nHe urged voters to not be scared and to cast their vote tomorrow, adding that security arrangements were being improved.\n\nMeanwhile, interim Balochistan Interior Minister Mir Zubair Jamali sought a report from DC Mandokhail on the Pishin blast.\n\nHe said that the country\u2019s enemies were looking to create instability. \u201cThe election process will not be affected by such an attack,\u201d Jamali asserted.\n\nCM Domki and Jamali prayed for the deceased and the speedy recovery of the wounded.\n\nOn the other hand, the Quetta Bar Association said it would observe three days\u2019 of mourning over the attacks.\n\n\u201cWe express deep sorrow and grief over the martyrdom of innocent people in the blasts of Pishin and Qila Saifullah,\u201d Quetta Bar Association President Malik Abid Kakar said in a statement.\n\n\u201cGovernment and law enforcement agencies have completely failed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have abandoned their responsibilities and are busy with other activities,\u201d he added.\n\nRise in terror activities\n\nToday\u2019s blasts came a day after at least nine grenade attacks targeting the election offices of candidates and polling stations were carried out in various areas of Makran division and Quetta.\n\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights voiced concern over \u201call acts of violence against political parties and candidates\u201d.\n\nAccording to an annual security report issued by the Centre for Research and Security Studies, Pakistan witnessed 1,524 violence-related fatalities and 1,463 injuries from 789 terror attacks and counter-terror operations in 2023 \u2014 marking a record six-year high.\n\nKP and Balochistan were the primary centres of violence, accounting for over 90 per cent of all fatalities and 84pc of attacks, including incidents of terrorism and security forces operations.\n\nLast week, 24 terrorists were killed during firefights and clearance operations in the Mach and Kolpur towns of Balochistan in three days, after security for\u00adces had thwarted three \u201ccoordinated attacks\u201d.\n\nFour security personnel and two civilians had embraced martyrdom during the operations.\n\nA week ago, an independent candidate was shot dead in the Siddiqabad area of KP\u2019s Bajaur district while on the same day, a worker of the Awami National Party (ANP) was killed during the party\u2019s election campaign in Balochistan\u2019s Qila Abdullah.\n\nThe next day, at least 10 bomb and grenade attacks rocked different areas of Balochistan in a single day, resulting in the death of one man.\n\nOn Monday, 10 cops were martyred while six were injured in a late-night attack on the Chodwan police station in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s Dera Ismail Khan.\n\nThe same day, three children were injured in a grenade attack on the election office of a PPP candidate in Hub, with unknown individuals carrying out six more grenade attacks, including those on proposed polling stations."

    "text": "The Surrey shooting is more than a mere crime; it is a complex web of international relations, community fears, and the haunting specter of vigilantism, as per Khalsa Vox. The shooting stands as a reminder of the challenges that lie at the intersection of domestic harmony and global diplomacy. An overnight shooting recently took place at the South Surrey residence of Simranjeet Singh, a friend of India-designated Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. In a statement, Surry RCMP said that they responded to reports of gunshots just after 1:20 am on February 1 at a residence located near the 2800 block of 154 Street. CBC News reported that Corporal Sarbjit Sangha said officers stayed in the area spoke to neighbors and witnesses, and are currently reviewing CCTV footage to find out more about the shooting. No one was injured. A CBC News reporter who went to the house on Thursday afternoon found a car that had been heavily damaged by gunfire, along with multiple bullet holes in the house itself. The shooting case took a politically charged turn when the spokesperson for the B.C. Gurdwaras Council Moninder Singh said the attack could be traced back to Indian foreign interference. This claim, rooted in the fact that the targeted home is closely tied to Nijjar's friend Simranjeet Singh, injects a layer of international intrigue into the investigation. Despite these allegations, the RCMP maintains a stance of caution, emphasizing that the true intent behind the shooting is still under rigorous scrutiny, as per Khalsa Vox. After the attack, the Sikh for Justice (SFJ) organization voiced its dismay over the perceived inadequacy of protection provided by Canadian authorities. The incident has ignited a fierce debate, with the SFJ openly contemplating the drastic measure of the Sikh community in B.C. taking security into their own hands, as quoted by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in an interview with the Vancouver Sun. The sentiment echoes a broader concern about the erosion of trust in the RCMP, a sentiment that found resonance in a pro-Khalistan social media account, which alluded to the potential formation of a militia by pro-Khalistan elements in Canada. The notion of a self-styled militia emerging within Canadian borders is not just a provocation; it's a direct affront to the authority of the state, threatening to escalate into a grave national security dilemma. It is imperative that the government and its agencies recognize the gravity of these developments and respond with due diligence and urgency, as per Khalsa Vox. While it's convenient for the pro-Khalistani elements to cast accusatory glances towards India, especially in light of the controversy surrounding the killing of Nijjar, the reality may be far more complex. The late-night attack, seemingly more an act of intimidation than an assassination attempt, casts doubt on the likelihood of India exacerbating its current diplomatic quandary with overtly aggressive actions. In this light, investigative agencies are urged to pursue a multifaceted approach, examining every conceivable angle, as per Khalsa Vox. (ANI)"

    "text": "Anti-junta forces claim to have downed 7 military aircraft since coup\n\nThe resistance's ability to attack aircraft would eliminate a major advantage of the junta.\n\nBy RFA Burmese 2024.02.06 -- Since Myanmar's coup three years ago, anti-junta forces claim to have shot down at least seven military fighter jets and helicopters - three in January alone - a serious blow to the military increasingly relying on its advantage in the air against underequipped rebel groups making gains on the ground.\n\nRadio Free Asia was unable to verify the shoot-downs, which rebels groups say were achieved mostly through small-arms fire. The military has said nothing about them.\n\nNearly all the incidents occurred within the past year, and three since the start of the year.\n\nIn the latest, on Jan. 29, a Eurocopter AS 365 Dauphin transport helicopter crashed in Kayin state's Myawaddy township. Joint forces of the ethnic Karen National Liberation Army, or KNLA, and the Cobra People's Defense Force, or PDF - ordinary citizens who have taken up arms - claimed responsibility for bringing it down.\n\nOn Jan. 3, the ethnic Kachin Independence Army, or KIA, claimed to have shot down a Mi-17 transport helicopter over Kachin state's Waingmaw township, as well as a FTC 2000G fighter jet over northern Shan state on Jan. 16.\n\nThe military has become wary after losing fighter jets and combat helicopters in recent months, said KIA information officer Col. Naw Bu, and is now exclusively using transport helicopters \"capable of carrying hundreds of bombs\" in its attacks on rebel forces.\n\n\"But they cannot use helicopters everywhere,\" he said. \"That's why ... they are experiencing difficulties.\"\n\nA former army officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, said that while anti-junta forces do not possess surface-to-air missiles and other sophisticated equipment, they are still capable of shooting down the junta's low-flying aircraft with weapons such as .50 caliber machine guns.\n\n\"Speaking of the plane that went down recently, the ground commander couldn't clear [anti-junta forces from] the ground, so the aircraft may have been shot down by snipers,\" he said.\n\nThe officer noted that the United States military lost more than 2,200 aircraft during flights over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia during the Vietnam War, including more than 1,700 to hostile action and more than 500 in accidents, despite having a significant advantage in the air over its enemies.\n\n\"Such things happen,\" he said. \"It can be said that these are common incidents.\"\n\nPivot to the air\n\nThe junta, which ousted the democratically elected government in a Feb. 1, 2021 coup d'etat, has deployed fighter aircraft and artillery attacks in the ensuing civil war with devastating effect, in many cases causing civilian deaths and widespread destruction.\n\nAnd as the rebel groups have seized more ground in recent months, junta commanders have increasingly turned to air attacks, opposition groups and military experts say.\n\nDuring the first year of the coup, 109 civilians were killed and 177 were injured by airstrikes and artillery attacks. During the second year, civilian casualties jumped almost four times to 328 killed and 768 injured. The most recent year - between Feb. 1, 2023, and Jan. 31, 2024 - 992 people were killed and 1,696 were injured, according to data compiled by RFA.\n\nU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk warned earlier this week that human rights abuses in Myanmar had \"deteriorated even further\" in recent months as the military has grown desperate amid a series of battlefield defeats, and called for sanctions to limit the junta's access to weapons, jet fuel, and foreign currency.\n\nThe first time rebels say they shot down a junta aircraft was in May 2021, just months after the coup, when the KIA claimed responsibility for taking out an Mi-35 attack helicopter that crashed in Kachin state's Momauk township.\n\nIt would be nearly two years until the next crash, when a PDF paramilitary group in Sagaing region's Homalin township claimed to have shot down a Russian-made Mi-17 transport helicopter on Feb. 3, 2023.\n\nIn June that year, the Karenni National People's Liberation Front, or KNPLF, said it shot down a K-8W light attack fighter jet over Kayah state's Bawlake township. Ethnic Karenni combined forces said they downed another K-8 fighter jet on Nov. 11 and were able to locate the crash site.\n\n'Generals' blood run cold'\n\nAs the war drags into the fourth year, the military will lose more aircraft, predicted Capt. Ze Thu Aung, who left Myanmar's Air Force to advise anti-junta groups as part of the Civil Disobedience Movement.\n\n\"Every resistance group now has an understanding of how to weaken the junta's airstrikes,\" he said. \"At the moment, everyone is already preparing for them. That's why the rate of military aircraft crashes has increased in 2023 and 2024.\"\n\nThan Soe Naing, a political commentator, said he believes that if more aircraft are destroyed, the military will lose its biggest asset, leading to \"a turning point in protecting the lives of the people.\"\n\nMore importantly, commentator Kyee Myint said, if the military's aircraft is shown to be susceptible to attack, it would mark a significant blow to the junta's tactical advantage over the armed resistance.\n\n\"It would make the generals' blood run cold,\" he said. \"Then, the resistance would no longer need to look up in fear.\"\n\nKawlin under attack\n\nThe latest crash came amid a fierce push by junta forces to retake Kawlin, in the northern Sagaing region, since the start of the month, with a combined force of some 800 soldiers supported by airstrikes, shelling and drone attacks.\n\nResidents said that the military had recently dropped a column of reinforcements by aircraft to assist in its fight for the town - a rice-producing area of economic and strategic significance to northern Sagaing.\n\n\"Everyone is afraid of both the ground troops and aerial attacks,\" said one resident who declined to be named, citing fear of reprisal.\n\nNearly 50,000 residents of Kawlin have fled the town since Feb. 1, after receiving reports of advancing troops and possible airstrikes, he said.\n\nTranslated by Htin Aung Kyaw and Aung Naing.

Officials said at least 15 people were killed in the attack and the wounded are being transported to a nearby hospital. Police said some of them were listed in critical condition.\n\nLater Wednesday, another bombing at the elections office of politician Fazlur Rehman's Jamiat Ulema Islam party in Qilla Saifullah town of Baluchistan killed at least 11 people, Acahkzai and local authorities said.\n\nJUI is one of the leading radical Islamist party and is known for backing the Afghan Taliban. JUI\u2019s religious schools are spread across the country, especially in the northwest and Baluchistan bordering Afghanistan. Many of Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban leaders studied at Islamic seminaries operated by JUI, yet Rehman and his party leaders in recent years have been attacked by the Islamic State group and other militants. Rehman and scores of candidates from his party are contesting the elections from various parts of Pakistan.\n\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, which came a day before Pakistan holds parliamentary elections.\n\nCaretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul-Haq-Kakar denounced the bombings in Baluchistan, and conveyed his condolences to the families of those who died. He vowed that \u201cevery attempt to sabotage the law and order situation will be thwarted.\u201d\n\nKakar said the government is committed to holding elections in a peaceful environment.\n\nCaretaker Interior Minister Gohar Ejaz also denounced the bombings, saying no one would be allowed to sabotage the election process.\n\nThe bombings came despite the deployment of tens of thousands of police and paramilitary forces across Pakistan to ensure peace following a recent surge in militant attacks in the country, especially in Baluchistan.\n\nThe outlawed Baluchistan Liberation Army has been behind multiple attacks on security forces, including a Jan. 30 attack on security facilities that killed six people.\n\nIn recent years, Pakistan has struggled to rein in surging militancy. Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups also have a strong presence in the Baluchistan province and have targeted civilians in recent years.\n\nThe gas-rich province at the border of Afghanistan and Iran has been the scene of a low-level insurgency by Baluch nationalists for more than two decades. Baluch nationalists initially wanted a share of the provincial resources, but later they initiated an insurgency for independence.\n\nViolence ahead of elections and on the day of polling is common in Pakistan. In one of the worst such attacks, Pakistan\u2019s two-time former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack in 2007, just minutes after she addressed an election rally in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. Her son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, led the campaign for her Pakistan People\u2019s Party until Tuesday night amid tight security.\n\n___\n\nAhmed reported from Islamabad.\n\nAbdul Sattar And Munir Ahmed, The Associated Press"

    "text": "\u201cI will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.\u201d\n\nEzekiel 36: 26-27 (NIV)\n\nWe have a reasonably sane Constitution of Lesotho 1993, we have laws governing every aspect of our socio-economic affairs and, every now and again, as we open up new frontiers, Parliament considers modern pieces of legislation such as the Computer Crime and Cyber Security Bill of 2020. We have documents such as the National Vision 2020 and the National Strategic Development Plan I and II. The NSDPs were preceded by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Interim National Development Framework (INDF). In the preface to NSDP I, it is stated that it would, like the PRSP and the INDF, serve as an implementation strategy for the National Vision 2020. The internet is awash with this and that developmental document pertaining to Lesotho and its fortunes. Good intentions. Well meaning. But look at this country in 2024. Four years after which the National Vision 2020 was supposed to have achieved its lofty ambitions for our beloved country. But the beloved country is crying in 2024; there is nothing to celebrate in the public sphere. Apart from policies and legal frameworks, we also have all manner of public institutions which derive their mandate from said laws. It is safe to say that most of our public institutions have been gutted by our destructive partisan political wars which know no bounds and are without principle or credible ideological foundations. Indeed, this society is a mirror into our soul as a Nation.\n\nAll this that we see unfolding before us is proof positive that there is a significant missing link that consistently characterizes our developmental efforts. I have taken to referring to Lesotho as Lesotho Inc. A country which must, for the large part, be run like a corporation in order to yield value for Basotho like any successful corporation would do for its shareholders.\n\nSo, what is the missing link in our developmental conceptualisation and initiatives? The building block of society: the person, the human being. We are neglecting holistic personal development at our peril. In some of these instruments, if this aspect is mentioned at all, it is more in the vein of, \u201coh, and by the way\u201d and yet, I am of the firm view that holistic personal development should be central to our developmental policies and laws as a Nation. A firm and coherent spiritual foundation must permeate every single legal instrument of this country starting with the Constitution. Not only should such a firm and coherent spiritual foundation permeate all our laws and policies, but we must live it. I am not talking about religion; we do that like clockwork every weekend and yet, here we are. Furthermore, we need to focus our attention on getting rid of this poverty mentality that dominates most of our socio-economic interactions. As a result of this poverty mentality, we fight tooth and nail for government tenders, we hire hitmen to get rid of our competitors on shortlists for corporate jobs, we cheat each other routinely on so-called collaborations (fairness and principle are always casualties of these ingrained practices), mistrust reigns and there is the ever-present expectation that our collaborator will \u201cshort\u201d us and, indeed, said collaborator always fulfils that prophecy because that is who we have chosen to become as a people.\n\nThe National Vision 2020 is a beautiful, inspiring, document whose core was developed mainly in 2001. That is 23 years of workshops, seminars, public broadcasts and other marketing activities, symposia, trips around the world for government Ministers, MPs, Principal Secretaries, Directors, and other senior government officials, but the results, are, to say the least, underwhelming. Why? Because we as a people have lost our core. Our values are questionable, our spirits and souls are hollow, we are a country that is in need of what I call a Person and People Transformation Revolution. We need to pause on the discredited \u201cReforms\u201d and have THIS conversation. What happened to us as a people? It starts with this basic question. A question I see us Basotho assiduously avoiding answering. Instead we are planning carnivals celebrating hollowness.\n\nMothepa Ndumo writes in her personal capacity.\n\nAdv Ndumo is a Legal Academic at the National University of Lesotho, a Pension Law Scholar in the Faculty of Law registered for a PhD focusing on the domestic investment of pension funds, a Thomas Psychometrics Practitioner, an Industrial Sociologist and Certified Executive and Leadership Coach.

    "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -- Two blasts near electoral candidates' offices in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan killed 24 people and injured dozens, local officials said on Wednesday, raising concerns over security in the lead up to Thursday's polls.\n\nPakistan goes to the polls amid rising militant attacks in recent months and the jailing of Imran Khan, the winner of the last national election, who has been dominating the headlines despite an economic crisis and other woes threatening the nuclear-armed country.\n\nAuthorities have said they are boosting security at polling booths.\n\nThe first attack, which killed 14, took place at the office of an independent election candidate in Pishin district. The second explosion in Qilla Saifullah, a town near the Afghan border, detonated near an office of Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI), a religious party that has previously been the target of militant attacks, according to the province's information minister.\n\nAt least 10 people were killed there, he said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who was behind the attacks. Several groups, including the Islamist militant Pakistani Taliban and separatist groups from Balochistan, oppose the Pakistani state and have carried out attacks in recent months.\n\n\"The Election Commission has asked the chief secretary and inspetor general of Balochistan for immediate reports and instructed them to take action against those behind the events,\" an Election Commission spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nKhanzai hospital, close to the site of the explosion in Pishin, gave the death toll as 14 and said more than two dozen were injured. The deputy commissioner of Pishin district, Jumma Dad Khan, said that the blast had injured many people.\n\nThe attacks came as political parties wrapped up their campaigning in the quiet period mandated by electoral rules the day before the election.\n\nJailed former Pakistani premier Khan earlier urged his supporters to wait outside polling booths after casting their votes, as rival political parties held large rallies to mark the end of the election campaign period.\n\nAny large-scale gathering of Khan's supporters near booths could raise tensions because of what they call a military-backed crackdown on him and his party that has restricted campaigning. The military denies interfering in politics.\n\n\"Encourage the maximum number of people to vote, wait at the polling station ... and then stay peacefully outside the Returning Officer's office until the final results are announced,\" said Khan via his handle on social media platform X, accompanied by an undated photograph depicting him wearing simple black clothing.\n\nThe origin of the image, the first of Khan in months, was not clear. Previously Khan's supporters have disseminated his messages, including through AI-generated audio speeches, from notes he has passed on through his lawyers during prison visits.\n\nOther political parties also wrapped up their campaigns.\n\nElectoral frontrunner Nawaz Sharif led a huge rally in the eastern city of Kasur, with his brother, former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who is running in that constituency.\n\nAmidst a sea of tens of thousands of supporters waving green party flags, Sharif called on the country's huge youth population to support his party and took aim at Khan who has previously attracted support from young voters in the area.\n\n\"Don't fall for him,\" Sharif said.\n\nSupporters of the rival Pakistan People's Party also gathered in the southern city of Larkana led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who could play king-maker if no one party receives enough parliamentary seats to form a government outright.\n\nThe former foreign minister and son of assassinated prime minister Benazir Bhutto criticised opponents, including Sharif, for what he described as compromising the country's security and economy during their tenures."

    "text": "A bill to provide Israel with more military aid went down to defeat Tuesday in the House, spoiling Speaker Mike Johnson's attempt to separate Israel from other national security priorities, including helping Ukraine defend itself from Russia's military invasion and deterring crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe vote gave individual lawmakers another chance to show voters their support for Israel and could be used on the campaign trail to criticize those who voted against it. But it did little to generate momentum toward passage of a final emergency spending package.\n\nIt was also the second setback of the day for House Republican leaders. Just minutes before the vote their drive to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas fell short due to opposition from three House Republicans.\n\nThe House had already gone on the record in support of an Israel aid package. Johnson brought that package up in November on one of his first days as the new House speaker. The vote was in response to Hamas and other militants killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking captive some 240 men, women and children in an Oct. 7 attack.\n\nWe're making it easier for you to find stories that matter with our new newsletter \u2014 The 4Front. Sign up here and get news that is important for you to your inbox.\n\nLast year's measure also included budget cuts to the Internal Revenue Service. This time, there were no attempts to offset the new spending, which ended up alienating some of the Republican members concerned about federal deficits. Meanwhile, Democrats largely remained opposed, concerned passage of the bill would leave no way to get Ukraine more aid. The bill did manage to gain more Democratic support than during November's vote but not nearly enough to pass.\n\nJohnson resorted to moving the bill through an expedited process that requires a two-thirds majority for passage. That's because Republicans were unlikely to even muster the simple majority needed to set the terms for the bill's debate. Such a procedural vote is generally a routine matter, but has become problematic for the current Republican majority, which can generally afford to lose only three Republicans on party-line votes. The vote for more Israel aid was 250-180, well short of the two-thirds threshold necessary for passage.\n\nFourteen Republicans ended up voting against the bill, concerned about the lack of spending cuts to offset the $17.6 billion price tag. That compares to 204 Republicans who voted for it. On the Democratic side, 46 voted for it and 166 against.\n\nPrior to the vote, the White House issued a statement announcing President Joe Biden's intent to veto the bill if it were to reach his desk. And Democratic leaders in both chambers said the only way forward requires a bipartisan approach.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for House Republicans to end the political stunts and come together in support of a comprehensive approach to our national security priorities,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and other members of leadership told colleagues before the vote.\n\nThe bill called for about $17.6 billion in military aid for Israel and for the replenishment of U.S. defense systems. About $4 billion would have gone to replenish Israel's missile defense systems and $1.2 billion to counter short-range rockets and mortar threats. There\u2019s also funding for the procurement of advanced weapons system and to enhance the production of artillery and other munitions.\n\nTo ensure the support does not compromise U.S. readiness, it includes $4.4 billion to replenish U.S. stocks of weapons provided to Israel. There\u2019s also $3.3 billion for current U.S. military operations in the region.\n\nJohnson said before the vote that since the House passed its first Israeli military aid package, the \u201csituation has gotten much more dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to stand with Israel right now and we cannot wait any longer,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAfter the vote, he said Democrats were using Israel to force through other priorities that don't enjoy the same degree of consensus.\n\n\u201cLeveraging Israel aid as it fights for survival is wrong,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nDemocrats said presidential politics played into the route House Republicans took in going ahead solely with aid for Israel.\n\n\u201cTrump doesn't want to support Ukraine, and he also doesn't want a border deal because it hurts him politically. What they get out of it is Donald Trump's approval,\" said Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democratic member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nRep. Lois Frankel of Florida was one of the Democrats who spoke in favor of the bill, saying she feared that \u201ca divided Congress will embolden Israel's adversaries and put our own military in harm's way.\"\n\n\u201cIsrael's security is our security,\u201d Frankel said.\n\nAcross the Capitol, a similar political debate took shape. Republicans overwhelmingly criticized a carefully negotiated plan unveiled over the weekend that included policies intended to curb illegal crossings with $60 billion in wartime aid for Ukraine, plus billions for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza.\n\nRepublicans said the border security provisions were inadequate while Democrats said Republicans were simply afraid to buck Trump even though they had insisted earlier that border security be included in an aid package for Ukraine. The divide leaves in question whether any emergency spending package will be passed.\n\n\u201cWe all know what\u2019s going on here: Donald Trump would rather keep the chaos at the border going so he can exploit it on the campaign trail, instead of letting the Senate do the right thing and fix it,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \u201cHe would rather let Ukraine suffer on the battle field instead of being tough on Putin.\u201d"

    "text": "By Matthew Lee, Wafaa Shurafa And Samy Magdy, The Associated Press on February 7, 2024.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) \u2013 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was set to meet Israeli leaders on Wednesday as Hamas suggested it was open to a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, but both sides remain dug in on thus far elusive goals as the war enters its fifth month.\n\nThe deadliest round of fighting in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has killed over 27,000 Palestinians, leveled entire neighborhoods, driven the vast majority of Gaza\u2019s population from their homes, and pushed a quarter of the population to starvation.\n\nIran-backed militant groups across the region have conducted attacks, mostly on U.S. and Israeli targets, in solidarity with the Palestinians, drawing reprisals as the risk of a wider conflict grows.\n\nIsrael remains deeply shaken by Hamas\u2019 Oct 7 attack, in which militants burst through the country\u2019s vaunted defenses and rampaged across southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting some 250, around half of whom remain in captivity in Gaza.\n\nThe United States, Israel, Qatar and Egypt have proposed a cease-fire of several weeks in return for a phased release of the hostages. Hamas responded to the offer late Tuesday in what it said was a \u201cpositive spirit\u201d\u009d while reiterating its core demands for an end to the Israeli offensive and the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, which President Joe Biden said were \u201ca little over the top.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war will continue until \u201ctotal victory\u201d\u009d over Hamas and the return of all the remaining hostages.\n\nBlinken, who is on his fifth visit to the region since the war broke out, is trying to advance the cease-fire talks while pushing for a larger postwar settlement in which Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel in return for a \u201cclear, credible, time-bound path to the establishment of a Palestinian state.\u201d\u009d\n\nBut the increasingly unpopular Netanyahu is opposed to Palestinian statehood, and his hawkish governing coalition could collapse if he is seen as making too many concessions.\n\nBlinken acknowledged \u201cthere\u2019s still a lot of work to be done.\u201d\u009d But he said he still believed an agreement on the hostages was possible. At a press conference in Qatar on Tuesday, he said a pathway to more lasting peace was \u201ccoming ever more sharply into focus\u201d but would require \u201chard decisions\u201d\u009d by the region\u2019s leaders.\n\nMISERY DEEPENS IN DEVASTATED GAZA\n\nThere is little talk of grand diplomatic bargains in Gaza, where Palestinians yearn for an end to fighting that has upended every aspect of their lives.\n\n\u201cWe pray to God that it stops,\u201d\u009d said Ghazi Abu Issa, who fled his home and sought shelter in the central town of Deir al-Balah. \u201cThere is no water, electricity, food or bathrooms.\u201d Those living in tents have been drenched by winter rains and flooding. \u201cWe have been humiliated,\u201d\u009d he said.\n\nThe Palestinian death toll from four months of war has reached 27,585, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run territory. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says most of the dead have been women and children.\n\nHamas has continued to put up stiff resistance across the territory, and its police force has returned to the streets in places where Israeli troops have pulled back. Hamas is still holding over 130 hostages, but around 30 of them are believed to be dead, with the vast majority killed on Oct. 7.\n\nIsrael has ordered Palestinians to evacuate areas that make up two-thirds of the tiny coastal territory. That covers the prewar homes of three-quarters of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people, according to the U.N. humanitarian office. Most of the displaced are packed into the southern town of Rafah near the border with Egypt, where many are living in squalid tent camps and overflowing U.N.-run shelters.\n\nISRAELIS AGONIZE OVER FATE OF HOSTAGES\n\nIn Israel, the focus is on the plight of the hostages, with family members and the wider public demanding a deal with Hamas, fearful that time is running out. Israeli forces have only rescued one hostage, while Hamas says several were killed in Israeli airstrikes and failed rescue missions.\n\nMore than 100 hostages, mostly women and children, were freed during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nThousands have taken part in weekly protests calling for the release of the hostages and demanding new elections. But Netanyahu is beholden to far-right coalition allies who have threatened to bring down the government if he concedes too much in the negotiations.\n\nThat could spell the end of Netanyahu\u2019s long political career and expose him to prosecution over long-standing corruption allegations.\n\nBut the longer the war continues, the greater risk it spills over into other countries, drawing the U.S. and its allies even deeper into a volatile region.\n\nIsrael and Lebanon\u2019s powerful Hezbollah militant group have been locked in a low-intensity conflict along the border since the start of the war in Gaza, and the Israeli-occupied West Bank has seen a surge in violence as Israel has launched nightly arrest raids.\n\nIran-backed groups in Syria and Iraq have launched dozens of attacks against bases housing U.S. troops and killed three American soldiers last week, drawing a wave of retaliatory airstrikes. The U.S. and Britain have also carried out strikes against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen in response to their attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea and disruption of global trade.\n\nThe Houthis, who portray their attacks as a blockade of Israel but have targeted ships with no known connection to the country, attacked two more ships early Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nShurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip and Magdy from Cairo.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of the Israel-Hamas war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war"

    "text": "Even as GOP hawks promote a dangerous new Mideast war with Iran, MAGA Republicans are pursuing a U.S. defeat in a much more critical conflict: Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia.\n\nYes, you read that correctly. On the one hand, Donald Trump decries President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cweakness and surrender\u201d over a drone attack by a radical Iraqi militia allied with Iran that killed three U.S. troops. This has prompted GOP demands that Biden bomb Iran \u2014 never mind that this could trigger the wider Mideast conflagration that everyone feared might be provoked by the war in Gaza.\n\nYet, at the same time, also obeying Trump, House Republicans are determined to cut off military aid for Ukraine. This, even though Democrats have bowed to GOP demands that this funding be linked to legislation to block the massive flow of migrants on the southern border. This aid cutoff would doom Kyiv in 2024 and convince Vladimir Putin that he need only wait for Trump, who, if elected, would consign Ukraine to Russian domination.\n\nBut the depth of the GOP\u2019s betrayal of U.S. security is even more severe than I have described. Contrary to many news reports, Ukraine has scored impressive sea victories in 2023 and could still force Putin to the table on Kyiv\u2019s terms.\n\nInstead, Trump\u2019s GOP is pushing for an unnecessary new Mideast war while promoting defeat in a war where Ukraine could still win.\n\nThis is an absurd moment to embark on a U.S. war with Tehran. U.S. focus needs to be on pursuing regional diplomacy over the war in Gaza \u2014 diplomacy that can bring Israeli hostages home, address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and, ultimately, neuter Hamas terrorists.\n\nIran has been using the excuse of the Gaza war to activate pro-Iranian militias \u2014 Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen \u2014 or Shiite militias in Syria and Iraq. They include the Iraqi band that managed to kill three soldiers at a small U.S. base in Jordan used to monitor resurgence of Islamic terror groups.\n\nYes, after these American deaths, the U.S. response must convince Tehran that its proxies must be restrained from blocking Red Sea maritime traffic and attacking U.S. bases. However, the goal should not be an all-out conflict with Iran that would embroil major U.S. forces.\n\nAs former NATO supreme commander James Stavridis proposed via Bloomberg, there are many options short of attacking the Iranian mainland. For example, use cybertools against Tehran\u2019s oil and gas infrastructure, hit an Iranian warship supporting its proxies in Yemen, or target Iranian oil and gas platforms in the Arabian Gulf.\n\nWhat is infuriating about the GOP\u2019s Mideast warmongering is not just the usual Trump hypocrisy (he backed off bombing Iran after a rocket attack by Tehran proxies in 2020 killed two Americans). Much more outrageous and anti-American is the Trump-led resistance in Congress to helping Ukraine push back an expansionist Russia \u2014 an adversary that poses a far greater threat to America than Iran.\n\nPutin has made clear that his imperialist goals in Europe go far beyond taking control of Ukraine. His threats of using nuclear weapons in Europe and against America are bluster. But if the U.S. bows to Putin on Ukraine, whether from fear or from Trump\u2019s embrace of autocrats, it will encourage the Russian leader and other dictators to undermine our interests on land, sea, and in space.\n\nWhat is particularly tragic is that Ukraine has achieved astonishing gains in 2023 that get insufficient attention in the mainstream press. Although Kyiv lacks a navy, it forced Russia to withdraw the bulk of its Black Sea fleet from Moscow\u2019s main naval base in occupied Crimea. It used sea drones invented by Ukraine\u2019s impressive tech sector, along with domestic cruise missiles, plus long-range missiles supplied by the United Kingdom and France.\n\nThe Ukrainians even managed to break Russia\u2019s blockade of Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea ports, which was driving up global food prices.\n\nI was in Odesa in July, when Moscow abandoned a U.S.-brokered deal to let grain ships leave the port city. Putin threatened to bomb any further grain exports and targeted grain silos in Odesa\u2019s harbor. But in August, Ukraine struck back and hit a Russian oil tanker near the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea\u2019s eastern coast, threatening Russian oil exports. The Russians blinked and pulled most of their fleet from Crimea back to Russia, enabling Ukraine to set up a new export corridor for grain and other goods.\n\nThe clear message: If you push back hard enough against Putin, he yields and abandons red lines. If the GOP permitted the passage of Ukraine aid \u2014 and if Biden would finally green-light the export of U.S. long-range ATACMS single warhead missiles \u2014 Ukraine could make the entire Crimean Peninsula untenable for Russian occupation. This would finally put Putin on the back foot and force him to reconsider his war.\n\nInstead, Trump tells Republican legislators to defeat an emerging bipartisan bill in the Senate that would link Ukraine aid to detailed protections for the southern border \u2014 a compromise demanded by the GOP. Meantime, the MAGA crowd pursues a circus impeachment vote against Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nThere are no two ways to describe the current degradation of the Republican Party. The party of Trump seeks to open a new Mideast war that would harm Americans and Israel \u2014 but godfathers defeat in a war that Ukraine could win.\n\nTrudy Rubin is a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer."

    "text": "Nearly 30,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Islamic militant group Hamas invaded Israel and murdered nearly 1,200 defenseless Israeli civilians and captured nearly 250 hostages. Israel retaliated in self-defense and retaliates to this day, with blockades, air attacks, ground assaults, and widespread (and allegedly indiscriminate) death-doling, with the stated intention of obliterating Hamas and taking control of the highly contested Gaza Strip.\n\nMelkite Catholics claim close connection to this war-torn region. The Melkites (or \u201cKing\u2019s Men,\u201d derived from the Aramaic word for king, \u201cmelek\u201d) are a Middle Eastern Byzantine Church in full communion with the Holy See and among the most ancient Catholics, arising largely from Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Palestine. Naturally, many Melkites are personally, or even spiritually, conflicted about the dreadful Israeli-Palestinian war, witnessing unholy, political horrors raging in their ancestral homeland and their religion\u2019s Holy Land.\n\nStriking from Palestine, Hamas represents the longstanding outrage of most Arabic states over Israel\u2019s sovereign presence east of the Jordan River. These largely regard Israelis with contempt as alien occupiers from Europe who were given a home 75 years ago that was not theirs by the U.N. and the British Empire, following more of a political project rather than a religious purpose. This violent tension has only been exacerbated over the decades by Israel\u2019s similar refusal to recognize the independence of Palestine.\n\nOrthodox. Faithful. Free. Sign up to get Crisis articles delivered to your inbox daily Email subscribe inline (#4) Email address Subscribe\n\nBut for the Melkites, there is devotion, dedication, and heritage connected with the Holy Land and the ancestral home of the Palestinians. So, how should the conscientious Melkite reconcile these alliances and oppositions and come to terms with such rampant casualties and the turmoil exploding from contested land?\n\nThis quandary flies immediately to the fact that the Israeli-Palestinian war is a tremendously complex crisis on humanitarian, political, and historical levels. Hamas is a terrorist organization that lashed out in jihadist ideology against its perceived invading enemy, the unwelcome Jewish people. Israel has lashed right back, taking advantage of the opportunity presented by Hamas\u2019 escalated hostility to claim Palestine once and for all as the last piece of territory that they perceive as their ancient, biblical right. The so-called \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d has never found traction and seems even more impossible with the current single state of war.\n\nBut when it comes to finding a Catholic position regarding such rancor of religions and regions, there are certain clear lines that must never be crossed: lines like terrorism, genocide, political ambition, and false beliefs regarding the Lord God. The war in Israel and Palestine is, from one perspective, largely a result of terrorism\u2014various Zionist terrorisms perpetrated ever since the modern state of Israel was created in 1948, when they forcibly removed nearly a million Muslims and Christians from their nation; and various Islamic terrorisms, most recently on October 7, 2023, perpetrated in the name of Palestine\u2019s sovereignty and Islamic freedom.\n\nAgain, the histories leading up to this war are deep and convoluted, and it is misguided to leap to any purely emotional or purely national or purely political conclusion, crying for ceasefire or homeland or alliance. This war is a long one that only found a certain escalation and international attention with the horrendous attacks on Israel by Hamas and then the relentless reprisal by Israel, with tensions exploding to answer the question of who will be the last people standing to claim Gaza and the inheritance of blood and faith that that blood-soaked, faith-stamped strip stands for.\n\nWhere should the Melkites stand in all of this? Simplistic though it may sound, Melkites are Catholic and Catholics must remain on the side of love, life, and peace\u2014though not at the sake of the righteous defense of one\u2019s nation and the true Faith\u2014and realize that the war being fought in the Holy Land is not a holy war from a Catholic point of view. While there is truth in the reminders that Hamas is not Palestine and the Jewish people are not Israel, the mentality dominating this war of extermination in the name of religion is not a true religious perspective\u2014and Catholics should renounce it on the most fundamental level.\n\nTherefore, Catholics, especially Melkite Catholics, who may feel caught in the middle of Arabic sympathy and Catholic history and morality, cannot take a side with terrorism under any banner. Further complication lies in the religions championed on both sides which are not the true religion. And finally, there is no Catholic position where annihilation of a people is being pursued, which is an end that is not divorced from either side.\n\nWhether militants of Hamas or Hezbollah, or citizens or politicians of Palestine or Israel, all men are made in the image and likeness of God and were made to secure salvation in the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. The mindset of Christians should be to establish and promote conversion to Christianity, and not champion either of these sides fighting for a faith that is false. With the ways and the wrongs of the world today, the only true path to peace on anything approaching a global scale lies in conversion. Conversion is the only answer, and wild and wayward though it may seem as a goal, it should be the solid and stated Catholic position through prayer and promotion. Whether militants of Hamas or Hezbollah, or citizens or politicians of Palestine or Israel, all men are made in the image and likeness of God and were made to secure salvation in the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.Tweet This\n\nIn the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, we pray for the \u201cunion of all,\u201d taken from St. Paul\u2019s letter to the Ephesians, which means we pray for the spiritual unity of all the people of God\u2014or the Churches of God\u2014that all people may be Christians, Catholics, and united within the Mystical Body of Christ. In this unity we pray for a correctness in the lives of all, for unity in true faith, true charity, and true adherence to the will of God. The Catholic mission is to pray and pursue a way of faith and life and love that is shared and embraced by all. Conversion and a single state of faith is the only solution.\n\nBut the war rages for religious reasons as well as political. Israel was promised a kingdom which is interpreted as all of Palestine, the Promised Land of the Chosen People and the fulfillment of the arduous journey of Judaism. On the other side, it is an Islamic tenet to seek Muslim dominion across the world and eliminate false worship. To capitulate and make way for infidels is sacrilege against their holy Dar al-Islam, their worldwide house of peace. Though Christian culture has abandoned the union of Church and State, its unity remains strong in other cultures. Religious fervors aside, Israel has a right to defend its borders, though its position on the map is disputed by natives with good reason. But that is a matter of political intrigue and not pious attitude, though the two are painfully intertwined in this case.\n\nMelkite Catholics should conclude that taking a side with Palestine shouldn\u2019t mean taking a side against Israel. Furthermore, the surest and most sacred place for Melkites to place their prayers and their opinions is that the grace of God must effect the miracle required to bring about the union of all beneath the one true Faith. It may seem like an impossible position to hope for or propose, but we believe that with God nothing is impossible. Pray, then, for the Melkites who are suffering in this moment in history, pray for the conversion of all Muslims and all Jews while loving their nations as lost sheep until all may be united in the peace of Christ.\n\n[Photo: Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch Youssef Absi sprinkles holy water on members of the congregation during the Good Friday service at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Dormition (Olive Church) in Syria\u2019s capital Damascus on April 15, 2022.

(Photo by AFP) (Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHamas has proposed a ceasefire plan that would quiet the guns in Gaza for four-and-a-half months leading to an end to the war, in response to a proposal sent last week by Qatari and Egyptian mediators and backed by the United States and Israel.\n\nAccording to a draft document seen by Reuters, the Hamas counterproposal envisions three phases lasting 45 days each.\n\nThe proposal would see militants exchange remaining Israeli hostages they captured on Oct. 7 for Palestinian prisoners. The reconstruction of Gaza would begin, Israeli forces would withdraw completely, and bodies and remains would be exchanged.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived overnight in Israel after meeting the leaders of mediators Qatar and Egypt in the most serious diplomatic push of the war so far aimed at reaching an extended truce. Details of Hamas's counteroffer have not previously been reported.\n\nAccording to the Hamas counterproposal, all Israeli women hostages, males under 19, the elderly and sick would be released during the first 45-day phase in exchange for the release of Palestinian women and children from Israeli jails.\n\nRemaining male hostages would be released during the second phase, and remains exchanged in the third phase. By the end of the third phase, Hamas would expect the sides to have reached agreement on an end to the war.\n\nThe group, which governs Gaza, said in an addendum to the proposal that it wished for the release of 1500 prisoners, a third of whom it wanted to select from the a list of Palestinians handed life sentences by Israel.\n\nThe truce would also increase the flow of food and other aid to Gaza's desperate civilians who are facing hunger and dire shortages of basic supplies.\n\nIsrael began its military offensive in Gaza after militants from Hamas-ruled Gaza killed 1,200 people and took 253 hostages in southern Israel on Oct. 7. Gaza's Health Ministry says at least 27,585 Palestinians have been confirmed killed in Israel's military campaign, with thousands more feared buried under rubble."

    "text": "Hamas has responded to a US-backed Israeli ceasefire plan for the war in Gaza with its own far-reaching proposal for a permanent end to the fighting.\n\nIt is a position Israel is almost certain to reject, but which mediators are viewing positively, as it appears the group is willing to engage in further negotiations.\n\nHamas put forward its three-stage plan late on Tuesday via Qatari and Egyptian mediators. Under the plan, Palestinian militants would exchange Israeli hostages they captured on 7 October for 1,500 Palestinian prisoners, secure the reconstruction of Gaza, ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and an exchange of bodies and remains, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.\n\nThe proposal envisions three phases of a truce, of 45 days each. It comes in response to a plan put forward by Israel two weeks ago for a six-week cessation of hostilities and the phased release of the estimated 130 Israelis still held hostage in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nIn the Hamas plan, all female Israeli hostages, males under 19, and elderly and sick people would be released during the first 45-day phase, in exchange for Palestinian women and children from Israeli jails. The remaining male hostages would be released during the second phase, and bodies exchanged in the third phase. By the end of the third phase, Hamas would expect the sides to have reached agreement on an end to the war.\n\nThe truce would also increase the flow of food and other aid to Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million desperate civilians, who are facing severe shortages of food, water and medicine.\n\nIsrael has not yet publicly commented on the details of the Hamas proposal, but several unnamed officials told local media that the demand to bring the war to a close was a \u201cnon-starter\u201d. A senior Israeli official told the country\u2019s Channel 12 News: \u201cThe meaning of Hamas\u2019s answer is a refusal to deal.\u201d\n\nThe US president, Joe Biden, also commented on Hamas\u2019s counter-proposal, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s been a response from Hamas, but it seems to be a little over the top \u2026 There\u2019s continuing negotiations right now.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has repeatedly said that the war will not end until there is total victory over Hamas. However, the unofficial Israeli position is likely to be more pragmatic.\n\nThe columnist Yoav Limor argued in the Israeli daily newspaper Israel Hayom: \u201cHamas\u2019s response is an opening position \u2013 a very high opening position, admittedly \u2013 but not one that entirely precludes the possibility of reaching a deal.\n\n\u201cObviously, Israel will not agree to the sweeping conditions that Hamas has posed \u2026 That said, Israel is prepared to discuss the details, such as the duration of the ceasefire, the quantity of aid allowed into Gaza and, of course, the number and identity of the prisoners who are to be released in exchange for the hostages. Presumably, that is what will happen now.\u201d\n\nA major sticking point in talks so far is how many and which Palestinians will be released. In the week-long November truce 110 Israelis were freed in return for 240 Palestinians who were mostly women and children held for minor offences or in administrative detention. But the new list is believed to include hardened militants serving life sentences.\n\nBoth sides are keen to blame the other for a failure to reach a second ceasefire deal. Hamas has set conditions that Israel is highly unlikely to accept, while Netanyahu faces the potential collapse of his far-right coalition government if Israel agrees to any sort of truce.\n\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, arrived in Israel overnight, part of his latest whistle-stop diplomatic tour of the region aimed at containing escalating violence across the Middle East triggered by the war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael began its military offensive in the strip after Hamas killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages in the devastating attack on Israel on 7 October last year.\n\nAt least 27,585 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli campaign, with thousands more feared buried under rubble, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. About 85% of the 2.3 million population have been displaced from their homes and more than half of the besieged Palestinian territory\u2019s infrastructure destroyed, the UN says."

    "text": "The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Tuesday issued an advisory, calling on Indian nationals in the Rakhine State of Myanmar to \u201cleave the State immediately.\u201d The development is the latest in a series of developments that followed the military coup of 2021.\n\nSince then, Myanmar\u2019s Junta army has been locked in violence with ethnic minority groups. The conflict escalated in October 2023, when three ethnic minority groups launched a coordinated campaign against the rule of the Myanmar military. In December last year, over 150 military personnel crossed the border to escape persecution and entered India\u2019s Mizoram province, forcing India to express concerns and ask for an early resolution to the issue.\n\nMEA Advisory for Indians\n\nIn a press release issued on February 6, the MEA said that due to the escalating violence, all Indians are advised to leave the turbulence-hit state immediately.\n\n\u201cIn view of the deteriorating security situation, disruption of means of telecommunications, including landlines, and severe scarcity of essential commodities, all Indian citizens are advised not to travel to the Rakhine State of Myanmar. Those Indian citizens who are already in Rakhine State are advised to leave the State immediately,\u201d the MEA said in an official release.\n\nIndia to fence entire Myanmar border\n\nContinuous infiltration of both Myanmarese military personnel and civilians has led to tensions in border regions. In an attempt to secure its border with Myanmar, Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced the fencing of the entire 1,643 km long mountainous border passing through Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. The decision would likely spell an end to the free movement regime enjoyed by both citizens to enter 16 km of each other\u2019s territories without visas for two weeks.\n\n\u201cThe Modi government is committed to building impenetrable borders. It has decided to construct a fence along the entire 1,643-kilometer-long Indo-Myanmar border,\u201d Shah said in a post on X demand from the Imphal Valley-based Meitei groups. India has already sealed a 10 km stretch in Manipur\u2019s Moreh region with permission to fence an additional 20 km already granted. Moreover, two pilot projects of fencing through a Hybrid Surveillance System (HSS) are under execution which aims to fence a stretch of 1 km each in Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur.\n\nThe security situation in the state has been a cause of concern since May last year after deadly violence erupted between two big ethnic communities of Manipur.\n\nArunachal CM hails border fencing decision\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu hailed the Centre\u2019s move to fence the India-Myanmar border, adding that it will check the movement of unscrupulous elements from across the border.\n\n\u201cA great move in the right direction to make our borders foolproof. Gratitude to Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji and Hon\u2019ble Home Minister Shri @AmitShah ji to fence our borders along Myanmar\u201d, Khandu posted on X.\n\nThe porous border between the two nations reportedly gives easy access to Myanmar-based insurgent groups staying in Myanmar to carry out unsocial activities in the three eastern districts of Arunachal Pradesh \u2013 Tirap, Changlang and Longding.\n\nMizoram, Nagaland CMs oppose the move\n\nMizoram Chief Minister Pu Lalduhoma and Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio have opposed the Centre\u2019s decision to set up barbed wire fencing along the India-Myanmar border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his meeting with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Lalduhoma termed this move as \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)"

Hunka was introduced as a hero who fought against the Russians during World War II and received a standing ovation from the entire Canadian legislature. The honoring of a Nazi collaborator prompted outcries from Russia, Poland and elsewhere. In October, Hunka was charged in absentia with genocide of civilians during World War II by the Russian Investigative Committee. He is accused of participating in large-scale executions of at least 500 civilians in the Lvov region of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1943-1944. The Russian Prosecutor General's Office told Sputnik in December that it had requested that Hunka be extradited to Russia to face criminal charges of genocide against Soviet citizens.\n\nhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20230925/untold-story-of-how-canada-became-a-safe-haven-for-ukrainian-wwii-era-nazis-1113656627.html\n\nrussia\n\ncanada\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\n2024\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\nNews\n\nen_EN\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\n1920 1080 true\n\n1920 1440 true\n\n1920 1920 true\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\nSputnik International\n\nyaroslav hunka, canada, nazi collaborator, russia, oleg stepanov"

In less than an hour, another explosion took place outside the election office of a Jamiat-Ulema Islam-Pakistan in the Killa Abdullah area claiming eight lives and injuring 12 others.\n\nThe condition of some of the injured is critical and they have been rushed to Quetta for treatment.\n\nSecurity officials examine the scene of a bomb blast in Khanozai, Pashin, a district of Pakistan\u2019s Baluchistan province, Wednesday, Feb. 7, 2024. (AP) Security officials examine the scene of a bomb blast in Khanozai, Pashin, a district of Pakistan\u2019s Baluchistan province, Wednesday, Feb. 7, 2024. (AP)\n\nMeanwhile, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has confirmed the two blasts and said security had been further enhanced in the province for Thursday\u2019s elections.\n\nA spokesperson of the ECP added that the perpetrators of these terror attacks will be caught and dealt with.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who was behind Wednesday\u2019s attack. Several groups, including the Islamist militant Pakistani Taliban and separatist groups from Balochistan, oppose the Pakistani state and have carried out attacks in recent months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJailed former Pakistan PM Imran Khan had earlier urged his supporters to wait outside polling booths after casting their votes, as rival political parties held large rallies to mark the end of the election campaign period. \u201cEncourage the maximum number of people to vote, wait at the polling station \u2026 and then stay peacefully outside the Returning Officer\u2019s office until the final results are announced,\u201d said Khan in a post on X, accompanied by an undated photograph depicting him wearing simple black clothing.\n\nViolence has been at its peak in Balochistan, bordering Afghanistan and Iran, in the lead-up to the February 8 general elections in Pakistan. On Tuesday, 10 grenade attacks were carried out at security posts, election campaign offices and rallies in different areas of the province.\n\nSince Sunday, there have been around 50 such attacks carried out in the province and in one incident in Sibi town attackers targeted an election rally of a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf candidate for the National Assembly in which four people lost their lives and six were injured.\n\n\u2013 With agency inputs"

The defense official said the base, known as Tower 22, was not outfitted with weapons that can take down aerial threats such as drones, and instead relied on electronic warfare systems designed to disable or disrupt their path to a target.\n\nAnother U.S. official affirmed to the Post the military\u2019s belief the drone flew too low to be detected.

    "text": "Rather than expanding on the excellent editorial on the opposite page Tuesday on the subject of a letter printed on this page last Friday, I'm going into word-nerd mode on a letter appearing here today. Politics have encroached into Every. Single. Area. of our lives. And in the fight over the definition of \"insurrection,\" we've headed there again.\n\nDang it. Just give me one day without politics messing up a delightful pastime. The days my word-nerdy social media feeds are infected with politics are days that are better spent playing Words With Friends or putting together a jigsaw puzzle. But here we are.\n\nThe word nerd in me (and likely several of you) takes issue with today's letter-writer's definition of \"insurrection\": \"A true insurrection is perpetuated by a very large number of armed citizens in revolt against a government, using violence, with the purpose of a complete overthrow of authority. Think of the American 'insurrection' against Great Britain, or the poor of France overthrowing the ruling monarchy in France. It is not a protest with a few who get out of hand.\"\n\nWhat you'll find when you look for a definition of insurrection usually falls along the same lines as Merriam-Webster's definition: \"an act or instance of revolting against civil authority or an established government.\" The dictionary goes further in a section about choosing the right synonym for the word (nuance is important, ya know).\n\n\"Rebellion, revolution, uprising, revolt, insurrection [and] mutiny mean an outbreak against authority. Rebellion implies an open formidable resistance that is often unsuccessful. ... Revolution applies to a successful rebellion resulting in a major change (as in government). ... Uprising implies a brief, limited, and often immediately ineffective rebellion. ... Revolt and insurrection imply an armed uprising that quickly fails or succeeds. ... Mutiny applies to group insubordination or insurrection especially against naval authority.\"\n\nOxford defines insurrection as \"a violent uprising against an authority or government.\" Cambridge says it is \"an organized attempt by a group of people to defeat their government and take control of their country, usually by violence.\" FindLaw Legal Dictionary defines it as \"the act or an instance of revolting [especially] violently against civil or political authority or against an established government; also the crime of inciting or engaging in such revolt.\"\n\nWe can debate the letter-writer's \"very large number\" till the cows come home, but the Capitol was literally overrun with people, intent on stopping the electoral certification, who broke windows and doors and fought anyone who tried to stop them from getting in, and many of them were in fact armed. We won't even get into the debate about rioters not being armed because they didn't fire any guns. Armed means having anything (knife, stun gun, bear spray, etc.) that could be used as a weapon, not specifically guns. There were guns found on at least three people arrested that day; the bulk of the rioters weren't searched.\n\nWhile the core definition is mostly correct, as far as I'm concerned, calling something like what happened Jan. 6, 2021, \"a protest with a few who get out of hand\" is downplaying that day's events.\n\nA year after that day, Time magazine published a piece discussing the history of the word \"insurrection\" in the U.S., specifically as it applies to Black Americans, by Hawa Allan, an attorney and author, in which she wrote, \"[T]here has been an ongoing and heated debate over whether to call the event an 'insurrection.'\n\n\"This much is undisputed: hundreds of rally attendees--some armed with metal flagpoles, baseball bats, pepper spray and stun guns--smashed their way into the Capitol building and loitered in the halls, splintering off to rummage through offices or maraud an empty chamber of Congress. Five people died [within 36 hours of] that day as a result of the clash between the crowd and Capitol police, and at least 140 were reportedly injured. However, the interpretation of those facts has largely diverged into polar opposites.\"\n\nWrote Allan: \"The crux ... lies in whether the crowd was truly violent--an attribution that has faced resistance. This distinction determines whether those who breached the Capitol are to be accurately described as 'rally goers' or 'rioters,' 'patriots' or 'terrorists,' 'peaceful protesters' or 'insurrectionists,'\" noting that the labels are neither benign nor interchangeable.\n\nConsidering the damage done to the Capitol, the injuries and deaths that resulted, hours of video showing officers and others being beaten with flagpoles and whatever else could be brought to hand, as well as the convictions of several Proud Boys and Oath Keepers members and leaders for conspiring to use violence to overturn the election, I'm going out on a limb and calling Jan. 6, 2021, an insurrection, confident that the mostly apolitical world of word nerds would agree.\n\nOthers won't, of course, but differences are what make conversations like this vital.\n\nAssistant Editor Brenda Looper is editor of the Voices page.

    "text": "Officers from the Metropolitan Police have been searching for Ezedi since last Wednesday after a woman and her two daughters, aged eight and three, were injured in the attack.\n\nThe 31-year-old mother may lose the sight in her right eye after being doused with corrosive liquid, police said.\n\nPolice have offered a \u00a320,000 reward to anyone with information leading to the 35-year-old\u2019s arrest after they released more CCTV of him as they piece together his movements.\n\nEzedi, believed to be from Afghanistan, is understood to have arrived in the UK in 2016, reportedly in the back of a lorry.\n\nHe was handed a suspended sentence at Newcastle Crown Court on January 9, 2018 after pleading guilty to charges of sexual assault and exposure and was instead being placed on the sex offender register for 10 years and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.\n\nEzedi was accused of grabbing the bottom of a woman without her consent in 2017, as well as committing a sex act that same year, according to documents detailing the indictment which were disclosed by the court to the PA news agency on Tuesday.\n\nUnder sexual offences laws, victims are granted lifelong anonymity unless they waive this right and choose to be identified.\n\nQuestions continue to swirl around how Ezedi came to be granted asylum in the UK despite his conviction, amid suggestions a tribunal judge ruled in favour of his claim after a priest confirmed he had converted to Christianity and was reportedly \u201cwholly committed\u201d to his new religion. It is understood the priest in question was not Roman Catholic or from the Church of England.\n\nOn Tuesday, the diocese of Newcastle, in the Church of England, confirmed it had found \u201cno evidence\u201d of Ezedi \u201cattending any of our churches, or being supported by our clergy in any asylum application\u201d.\n\nIt added that its clergy \u201cwill continue to support asylum seekers as they engage with the Home Office application process, and the scrutiny this involves\u201d.\n\nBishop of Chelmsford Guli Francis-Dehqani, who came to the UK as a refugee, said it was \u201csaddening\u201d for politicians to claim a link between abuse in the asylum system and the actions of clergy in the wake of the case.\n\nWriting in The Telegraph, she said she makes \u201cno apology for our involvement in supporting people who are often deeply vulnerable and traumatised\u201d.\n\nShe said religious ministers from all denominations occasionally provide statements of support to people seeking asylum but added: \u201cThe notion that a person may be fast-tracked through the asylum system, aided and abetted by the Church is simply inaccurate.\u201d\n\nThe debate over the clergy\u2019s involvement in the asylum system comes after religious leaders, including the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, vocalised their opposition to the Government\u2019s plan to send migrants seeking sanctuary in the UK to Rwanda.\n\nOn Tuesday, police said \u201cpainstaking work\u201d by counter terrorism officers \u2013 who are \u201chighly experienced in manhunts and tracking offenders\u201d and have been drafted in to help scour hundreds of hours of CCTV \u2013 meant Ezedi had now been traced from his last-known position at 9.47pm on Allhallows Lane in the City of London.\n\nAt 9.54pm he travelled along Upper Thames Street and then into Pauls Walk, passing the City of London School and then towards Blackfriars Bridge.\n\nThe most recent sighting is at 10.04pm when he passed the Unilever building and headed towards Victoria Embankment, the Met said.\n\nThey tracked his movements around the Tube network using his bank card, but it has not been used since that day.\n\nCommander Jon Savell said it \u201cremains our belief that he is being helped by others\u201d and the police probe will continue to \u201ctarget more of Ezedi\u2019s associates\u201d.\n\nOfficers arrested a 22-year-old man on suspicion of assisting an offender on Monday and later released him on bail.\n\nPolice said there is no evidence to suggest Ezedi had made advance preparations to go on the run.\n\nDetectives are working on the premise that he is either being hidden by someone or has come to harm.\n\nEzedi, who is from Newcastle, is not the father of the children in the attack and was in the capital visiting the victim, police believe.\n\nMore than 100 officers are now \u201cdedicated\u201d to the investigation, including experienced detectives through to local neighbourhood officers, with the Met being \u201csupported by \u201cdozens of officers\u201d from forces across the UK, including in Northumbria and British Transport Police.\n\nThe Met is also in touch with the National Crime Agency, the Home Office, UK Border Force and UK Visas and Immigration, with details of Ezedi circulated to all UK police forces and ports.\n\nMore than 200 calls have been received from members of the public with potential sightings, but they have since been discounted.\n\nEzedi allegedly threw the younger child to the ground during the attack at 7.25pm before attempting to drive away from the scene, crashing into a stationary vehicle and fleeing on foot.\n\nThree members of the public who came to the aid of the family during Wednesday\u2019s attack, two aged in their 30s and one in her 50s, have all been discharged from hospital with minor burns."

If the Queen requires similar repairs to those the Prince underwent, HMS Queen Elizabeth and her arsenal of up to 36 F-35's and 4 helicopters will be unable to participate in the Steadfast Defender exercise nor in any other seagoing operations until this time next year. This timeline is, as the Brits often say, \"Highly likely\". The Queen is, as of now, unable to fulfill her duty in Steadfast Defender, as well as any upcoming Red Sea military operations, so, The Prince will have to take up the duty, barring any recurring problems with the Prince's own shaft, which if they occurred, would leave the entire UK carrier fleet under repair for the \"biggest NATO exercise since the Cold War\" and at a time of significant and escalation naval combat operations in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. A rather inauspicious beginning to the NATO exercise and the kingdom that once \"ruled the waves\".While the primarily naval/logistical part of the operation will continue from now until mid-March, the land warfare phase will last from mid-March through the end of using 90,000 NATO from and in the following NATO nations: Finland, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, and the UK.The movement of 90,000 NATO soldiers into the areas bordering Russia and Ukraine is also a prime opportunity to continue the importation of thousands of foreign mercenaries into the depleted ranks of Ukrainian cannon fodder. There are two separate variants foreign mercenaries in Ukraine these days - on the one hand, you have the Tik Tok Tourists, here only for the photo ops and bargain brothels, the low budget assassins from the narco-cartels in Central and South America, here to make gun, drug, and human trafficking connections, cheap and expendable, ideal candidates for suicide missions, who don't have to even be buried, much less paid. On the other hand, you have field grade NATO officers, highly trained weapons technicians and special forces \"operators\" from the elite units of the NATO militaries. Steadfast Defender is an opportunity to give these expert torturers and killers, these trained terrorists, a free ticket to Ukraine, with all their gear.Meanwhile, the Russian Army continues to advance all across the Donbass Front, particularly in the area of Kupyansk, where Ukrainian media have been spreading rumors in recent days of 40,000 Russian soldiers and 1,100 tanks and IFV's. There is little to no evidence of such a massive build-up, and competent analysts have floated a theory that these announcements are really a cover excuse for a forthcoming retreat by Ukrainian forces to the western side of the Oskol River, which runs through the middle of Kupyansk. Either way, another significant Ukrainian retreat appears likely in the short term.The recent horrific massacres of civilians in the Tekstilshchik market of Donetsk, and the HIMARS bombing of the bakery in Lisichansk are both indicative of Ukrainian desperation and their abject evil. Ukraine and NATO cannot win this war with conventional weapons, and they know it. The world knows it. But these kinds of crimes will continue for as long as the criminal regimes of the West continue to supply high-power long-range weapons to mass murderers and war criminals, or until, (not \"if\", but \"when\") Russia delivers a decisive defeat to the Ukrainian Nazis and their foreign masters. The same applies equally to the Israeli regime and their henchmen attacking Palestine and Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. And beyond. The looming question of the next few months will be whether Russia, along with the Axis of Resistance and our other allies around the world can deliver this finishing blow without our enemies resorting to unconventional NBC weapons, and truly starting World War 3, by forcing us to do the same. It will be a very dangerous Summer - in Ukraine and Europe, the Red Sea and the Middle East. Good luck to all good people. May God bless and protect the innocent and those who defend them. And may the rest of us get everything we deserve.\n\nhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20240201/steadfast-defender-2024-key-facts-about-natos-largest-drills-since-1988-1116539134.html\n\nhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20240122/natos-steadfast-defender-exercises-threaten-europes-security-1116319041.html\n\nukraine\n\nrussia\n\nunited kingdom (uk)\n\ndonetsk region\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\n2024\n\nRussell Bentley https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e6/03/1d/1094281697_332:0:1182:850_100x100_80_0_0_f4d7604e530b3861449b2db55c72f353.jpg\n\nRussell Bentley https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e6/03/1d/1094281697_332:0:1182:850_100x100_80_0_0_f4d7604e530b3861449b2db55c72f353.jpg\n\nNews\n\nen_EN\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\n1920 1080 true\n\n1920 1440 true\n\n1920 1920 true\n\nSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60\n\nRussell Bentley https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e6/03/1d/1094281697_332:0:1182:850_100x100_80_0_0_f4d7604e530b3861449b2db55c72f353.jpg\n\nrussell bentley on nato, russell bentley on ukraine, russell bentley on nato drills, russell bentley on nato expansion, nato enlargement, nato expansion, who\u2019s joining nato, finland and sweden in nato, new nato members, why is hungary against nato expansion, why is nato expanding, nato expanding eastward"

    "text": "February 7, 2024\n\nSaudi Arabia clapped back at the United States\u2019 claims that discussions on a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal were moving forward separately from talks on a Gaza cease-fire.\n\nIn a statement released early Tuesday, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said the kingdom has informed Washington that there will be no diplomatic relations with Israel until an independent Palestinian state is established on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, and unless Israel ends its offensive on the Gaza Strip and withdraws its troops from the enclave.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia has always been steadfast on the Palestinian issue and the necessity that the brotherly Palestinian people obtain their legitimate rights,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe statement further called on the UN Security Council to expedite the recognition of the Palestinian state \u201cso that the Palestinian people can obtain their legitimate rights and so that a comprehensive and just peace is achieved for all.\u201d\n\nThe Saudi statement came hours after White House National Security spokesman John Kirby claimed that the US administration had received \u201cpositive feedback\u201d that Saudi Arabia and Israel are willing to continue to have normalization discussions.\n\nKirby was speaking at a press briefing late on Monday. When asked whether securing a hostage deal between Hamas and Israel and a normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel are part of the same US efforts, the US official said the two issues were separate things.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working very hard \u2026 to try to come to closure on another hostage deal and an extended pause that will allow us to get the remaining hostages home with their families, to get more assistance in [Gaza], and certainly to reduce harm to civilians,\u201d Kirby said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we were, before the 7th of October, and are still now having discussions with our counterparts in the region, Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 obviously, the two key ones \u2014 about trying to move forward with a normalization arrangement between Israel and Saudi Arabia,\u201d he added.\n\nNormalization talks face setback\n\nBefore the Israel-Hamas war erupted Oct. 7, Washington had been pushing to bring Saudi Arabia into the 2020 Abraham Accords, under which the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain normalized relations with Israel.\n\nLast September, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) said that his country and Israel were getting closer to normalization.\n\nBut after Hamas launched its cross-border assault on southern Israel, prompting a brutal Israeli military response in the Gaza Strip, Saudi Arabia reportedly paused discussions on a deal with Israel. Since then, Saudi officials have stressed the need to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace and secure the rights of Palestinians before moving forward with any normalization deal.\n\nFor his part, Israel\u2019s President said that normalization would be a key element to ending the war with Hamas. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in mid-January, Herzog added that such a deal represents \u201can opportunity to move forward in the world and the region toward a better future.\u201d\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly rejected a US proposal to achieve normalization with Saudi Arabia in exchange for Palestinian statehood. Citing three unnamed senior US officials, NBC News said last month that Netanyahu told Blinken during a visit to Israel that \u201che\u2019s not prepared to make a deal that allows for a Palestinian state.\u201d\n\nMore than 27,585 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in the Israeli air and ground campaign on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The Israeli military has vowed to continue its war until all of Hamas is eliminated and all hostages taken by the movement during its cross-border assault return home.\n\nHamas militants killed around 1,200 people and took over 240 other hostages when it launched its unprecedented attack in southern Israel Oct. 7. A total of 110 hostages were freed during a brief seven-day truce in late November, while Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners. Since then, the US, along with Egypt and Qatar, have been working to secure another exchange deal between Israel and Hamas.\n\nMeanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with MBS in Riyadh earlier this week as part of a Mideast tour. The two officials discussed the latest developments in the region, including in the Gaza Strip and Red Sea, where the Iran-backed Houthis have stepped up their attacks on commercial vessels.\n\nAccording to a State Department readout, Blinken and MBS agreed on the need to end the war in Gaza through regional coordination, in order to achieve lasting peace for both Israel and Palestinians.\n\nBlinken arrived in Israel on Wednesday, following stops in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar."

(Photo by Farooq NAEEM / AFP) (Photo by FAROOQ NAEEM/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAn explosion took place near an election candidate\u2019s office in Pakistan\u2019s southwestern province of Balochistan, a local official said on Wednesday, killing 12 people and raising concerns over security in the lead up to Thursday\u2019s election.\n\nPakistan goes to the polls amid rising militant attacks in recent months and the jailing of Imran Khan, the winner of the last national election, who has been dominating the headlines despite an economic crisis and other woes threatening the nuclear-armed country.\n\nAuthorities have said they are increasing security at polling booths. The attack took place at the office of an independent election candidate.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who was behind Wednesday\u2019s attack. Several groups, including the Islamist militant Pakistani Taliban and separatist groups from Balochistan, oppose the Pakistani state and have carried out attacks in recent months.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nKhanzai hospital, close to the site of the explosion, gave the death toll as 12 and said more than two dozen were injured. Deputy commissioner of Pishin district, Jumma Dad Khan, said that the explosion had injured many people.\n\nThe attack came as political parties wrapped up their campaigning in the quiet period mandated by electoral rules the day before the election.\n\nJailed former Pakistani prime minister Mr Khan earlier urged his supporters to wait outside polling booths after casting their votes, as rival political parties held large rallies to mark the end of the election campaign period.\n\nAny large-scale gathering of Mr Khan\u2019s supporters near booths could raise tensions because of what they call a military-backed crackdown on him and his party that has restricted campaigning. The military denies interfering in politics.\n\n\u201cEncourage the maximum number of people to vote, wait at the polling station ... and then stay peacefully outside the Returning Officer\u2019s office until the final results are announced,\u201d said Mr Khan on social media platform X, accompanied by an undated photograph depicting him wearing simple black clothing.\n\nThe origin of the image, the first of Mr Khan in months, was not clear. Previously Mr Khan\u2019s supporters have disseminated his messages, including through AI-generated audio speeches, from notes he has passed on through his lawyers during prison visits.\n\nOther political parties also wrapped up their campaigns.\n\nElectoral front-runner Nawaz Sharif led a huge rally in the eastern city of Kasur, with his brother, former prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, who is running in that constituency.\n\nAmid a sea of tens of thousands of supporters waving green party flags, Mr Sharif called on the country\u2019s huge youth population to support his party and took aim at Mr Khan who has previously attracted support from young voters in the area.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall for him,\u201d Mr Sharif said.\n\nSupporters of the rival Pakistan People\u2019s Party also gathered in the southern city of Larkana led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who could play kingmaker if no one party receives enough parliamentary seats to form a government outright.\n\nThe former foreign minister and son of assassinated prime minister Benazir Bhutto criticised opponents, including Mr Sharif, for what he described as compromising the country\u2019s security and economy during their tenures. \u2013 Reuters"

    "text": "New Delhi [India], February 7 (ANI): Launching a no-holds-barred attack on Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that his belief has been confirmed the grand old party has turned 'outdated' in its thinking.\n\nWhile replying to the Motion of Thanks to the President's address in Rajya Sabha, the Prime Minister said that the party which has no guarantee of its own leader and policy, is raising questions on Modi's guarantee.\n\n\"My belief has been confirmed that this party has become outdated in its thinking. And when even the thinking has become outdated, they have outsourced their work also. Within no time, such a big party, who ruled the country for decades has plunged this much. We are not happy,\" PM Modi said.\n\nHe said that the party that has left no stone unturned to divide the country in the name of caste and language is giving lectures on democracy and federalism.\n\n\"I will definitely say this to put the point before the country, the Congress which had openly strangled democracy in the greed for power, the Congress which had dissolved the democratically elected governments dozens of times overnight. The party that has left no stone unturned to divide the country in the name of caste and language is giving lectures on democracy and federalism. A party that allowed terrorism and separatism to flourish in its own interest. Which pushed the Northeast into violence and backwardness? Who handed over a huge chunks of land to the enemies. Those who stopped the modernization of the country's army are today giving us speeches about national security and internal security,\" he added.\n\nThe Prime Minister accused the Congress of spreading a negative narrative of the country.\n\n\"Congress spread the narrative, as a result of which people who believed in Indian culture and values started being viewed with an inferiority complex...the world knows very well where it narrative was coming...'Made in Foreign' was made a status symbol. These people can never talk about 'Vocal for Local' and 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat'...In her address, the President addressed all of us in detail about the 4 largest castes. These 4 castes are -youth, women, poor and our food providers. We know that they have similar problems and dreams. The ways to solve the problems of these four categories are also similar...\" the PM said.\n\nThe PM also alleged that the Congress had promoted a colonial mindset even after independence.\n\n\"The British were remembered in this House, Raja-Maharajas had a close connect with the British at that time...I would like to ask - who was inspired by the British? Even after independence, who promoted colonial mindset in the country? If you were not inspired by the British, why did you not changed the IPC drafted by them? Why did you let the hundreds of laws that were framed by them, continue? Why did the red beacon culture continue even after decades? India's Budget used to be tabled at 5 pm because the British Parliament used to convene at that time in the morning...Who was inspired by the British? Why did Rajpath have to wait for Modi to become Kartavya Path?\" he said.\n\nThe PM also rubbished the caste-census plank that the Congress has been campaigning on.\n\n\"The Congress which never gave complete reservation to OBCs, never gave reservation to the poor of the general category, which did not consider Baba Saheb worthy of Bharat Ratna, kept giving Bharat Ratna only to its family. They are now preaching and teaching us the lesson of social justice. Those who have no guarantee as a leader are raising questions about Modi's guarantee....\"\n\nThe Prime Minister underlined the achievements of his government saying that it had successfully taken India to top 5 economy from the fragile 5.\n\n\"In the 10 years of Congress, the Indian economy was in fragile five. Congress government was known for policy paralysis. On the other hand, in our 10 years, India has been one of the top five economies. Our 10 years will be remembered for big and decisive decisions.\"\n\nDuring his speech, the Prime Minister said that President Droupadi Murmu in her address spoke about India's potential, strength, and bright future and thanked her for address to the joint sitting of two Houses of Parliament.

    "text": "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 With the embattled U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza teetering on the brink of financial collapse, one of its biggest donors is wavering over whether to extend it a lifeline worth tens of millions of dollars within the next few weeks.\n\nIsrael\u2019s allegations that 12 employees of the aid agency known as UNRWA participated in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in southern Israel shook the organization last month. Several countries suspended funding worth some $440 million, almost half of the agency\u2019s annual budget. Two U.N. investigations are underway.\n\nUNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said the agency might cease operations in late February without more money.\n\nIts third-biggest donor \u2013 the European Union \u2013 is due to make an 82-million-euro ($88-million) payment at the end of the month. But the 27-nation bloc\u2019s executive branch has demanded an audit of the agency by EU-appointed independent experts.\n\nThe audit would focus \u201cspecifically on the control systems needed to prevent the possible involvement of (UNRWA) staff in terrorist activities,\u201d the European Commission said. The commission also insists on \u201ca review of all UNRWA staff\u201d to confirm they had no role in the attacks.\n\nOf the U.N. agency\u2019s 13,000 Gaza staff members, more than 3,000 continue working. Screening them within weeks would be impossible, and time is of the essence. The agency has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter during the war in Gaza, where around 85% of the population has been displaced.\n\n\u201cShould UNRWA cease or limit services, which may be the case as early as the end of February, it would significantly aggravate the ongoing dramatic humanitarian crisis,\u201d EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell wrote in a blog on Sunday, a day after discussing the issue with the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers.\n\n\u201cThe lives of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, not only in Gaza, are at stake,\u201d Borrell warned.\n\nAsked Monday which experts had been appointed, by whom, and what progress had been made on the audit, the commission could provide no clear answer. \u201cWe don\u2019t have additional information to share on this,\u201d spokeswoman Arianna Podesta said.\n\nIn a statement emailed to The Associated Press, UNRWA said it \u201cis in regular contact with the European Commission on the way forward, including the audit.\u201d It said it\u2019s \u201cthankful for the EU\u2019s essential support to the agency\u2019s humanitarian action in Gaza.\u201d\n\nAmong the 27 EU countries, several have suspended funding. Germany, the second biggest UNRWA donor after the United States, said it \u201cwill temporarily not approve any new funds\u201d until investigations are concluded. France, Italy and The Netherlands have taken a similar position.\n\nThe combined weight of its member states and institutions makes the EU the world\u2019s biggest provider of assistance to the Palestinians; almost 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) was earmarked for 2021-2024. But the members are deeply divided over their support for Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nThe commission, which has senior staff drawn from across Europe, has at times been similarly split.\n\nDays after the Hamas attack, Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi of Hungary, a staunch backer of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, announced that all EU development funds to the Palestinians would be \u201cimmediately suspended. All projects put under review.\u201d\n\nJust hours later, the commission backtracked, saying there would be \u201cno suspension of payments.\u201d Indeed, no payments were even due. A subsequent commission investigation found no evidence that EU money was diverted to Hamas.\n\nUNRWA currently is the focus of two investigations. One, ordered by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, is a probe of the allegations made by Israel. The U.N.'s in-house watchdog, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, is to carry it out.\n\nIsrael has long accused UNRWA of tolerating or even collaborating with Hamas activities in or around U.N. facilities, but the government has stopped short of demanding the agency\u2019s immediate closure. No one \u2013 in Israel or abroad \u2013 has offered an alternative for delivering aid to Gaza\u2019s besieged population.\n\nThe second investigation is an independent review that UNRWA chief Lazzarini requested. Former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna will lead it, backed by three research organizations. Guterres said Monday that a final report will be completed by late April and made public.\n\nThe review is supposed to focus on the way the agency ensures that it remains neutral and responds to allegations that it failed to do so. Colonna\u2019s team plans to look at whether the system works and how it might be improved.\n\nIsrael receives a list each year of the UNRWA staff members working in Gaza and the West Bank. No complaints were made when the last one was shared in May 2023, the agency said.\n\n\u201cUNRWA never received from the government of Israel a response to the content of these lists, let alone an objection,\u201d the agency told AP.\n\nSome EU countries intend to increase their funding of the agency even without the investigations completed, Borrell said. The EU\u2019s top diplomat believes that freezing UNRWA out could amount to collective punishment.\n\n\u201cIf some doctors in a European hospital were involved in criminal activities, there would be a thorough investigation and all appropriate actions would be taken,\u201d he wrote Sunday. But, Borrell added, \u201cno government would ever stop funding the health service, as this would primarily punish the people who receive these services.\u201d\n\nLazzarani is scheduled to meet with Borrell and other EU ministers in Brussels on Monday.\n\n___\n\nJosef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of the Israel-Hamas war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war"

Israel would release an additional 1,500 Palestinian prisoners, including 500 specified by Hamas \u2013 likely high-profile militants serving life sentences.\n\nIsrael would withdraw its forces from population centers, halt aerial operations and allow in far more humanitarian aid and the start of reconstruction. It would also allow displaced people to return to their homes, including in northern Gaza, and open all crossings.\n\nIn the second phase, which would be negotiated during the first, Hamas would release the remaining hostages, mainly soldiers and civilian men, in exchange for more prisoners, and Israel would complete its withdrawal from Gaza. The two sides would exchange the remains of deceased hostages and prisoners in a third stage, which would give way to a long-term truce.\n\nA Hamas official and two Egyptian officials confirmed the authenticity of the document published by Lebanon\u2019s Al-Akhbar newspaper on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the sensitive negotiations. The newspaper is close to Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militant group, an ally of Hamas."

    "text": "While fighting Russian electronic warfare (EW), Ukrainian forces have developed new electronic warfare systems faster than Russia can create countermeasures or attack methods. The objective of EW is to tap into enemy electronic signals and hijack or block them while preventing the enemy from doing the same to you. The electronic signals here chiefly involve radio for communicating with or controlling UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). These signals can be blocked by the enemy or even hijacked so the enemy can take control of your UAVs. This can be done so that the owner of the UAV doesn\u2019t realize it until the enemy suddenly takes control and uses your UAV against you.\n\nThe same method can be used with radar to either manipulate the signal so that it makes the enemy radar user believe nothing is out there or that what the enemy radar shows is not where it actually is or that there are multiple items indicated when there is actually only one. Radar jamming has become increasingly sophisticated, and aircraft can carry a container of EW equipment, like a bomb underneath a wing. These EW pods contain a wide variety of EW options. These pods are often updated to detect and manipulate certain signals. The Americans obtained current Russian EW equipment and scrutinized them. Their findings were shared with the Ukrainians and some NATO allies.\n\nCombat operations are often thrown into chaos for those who are not prepared to handle all the EW operations they encounter. Ukrainian forces managed to cope and deal with the considerable EW capabilities the Russians used. This cost the Russians the element of surprise in some future encounter with the Americans or other NATO countries. The United States developed a lot of EW equipment and techniques during the Cold War but had little use for that since the 1990s. The Ukrainians receive military support from the Americans and other NATO countries, and this led the United States to bring back its Cold War era EW technology and, with Ukrainian help, update it.\n\nDuring the Cold War the Russians built vehicles that carried a large assortment of EW equipment, as well as generators to produce enough power to keep EW equipment going. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russia continued developing EW devices and techniques. The best and most powerful EW equipment were only used in situations where the opposition was dependent on electronic signals for communications, control, or surveillance. No matter what the situation, Russia employed some EW to gain an advantage.\n\nIn 2010 Russia deployed the Krasukha-4, truck mounted EW system and sent them to Syria and where the Krasukha-4 used its directed energy sonic cannon during 2018 to damage the electronics of an American AH-64 helicopter gunship, forcing the helicopter to land. In 2021 Israeli units operating near the Lebanese and Syrian borders had problems with Krasukha-4 signals and the more compact Sapphire EW system. In 2023 Russia began exporting Krasukha and Sapphire EW systems. After the Russians invaded Ukraine in 2022, the Ukrainians captured a damaged Krasukha system and gave it to the Americans, who sent it back to the United States for further investigation.\n\nSince 2015 Russia has been using eastern Ukraine and Syria for testing new EW equipment and techniques under combat conditions to discover weaknesses and promote export sales as combat proven. Equipment still in development is also tested and sometimes modified on the spot. A recent example of that is the truck mounted Tirada-2 orbital jamming system that recently showed up in eastern Ukraine. Tirada-2 was seeking to hack the control signals and video feeds from American RQ-4B Global Hawk UAVs that regularly operated over eastern Ukraine. This would provide a look at what these UAVs see when they monitor Russian activity. Some RQ-4Bs are equipped with space satellite quality electronic sensors and the Russians were hoping to get an opportunity to monitor and perhaps hack those systems. Ukrainian and Western intelligence was aware of the existence of Tirada-2 if only because a less capable export model was being offered for sale. But now the more capable non-export Tirada-2 appears to have shown up in Eastern Ukraine but, as one would expect, no one was providing any details of who has been able to do what to whom.\n\nHacking and jamming satellites is nothing new. Even Islamic terrorists are active in this area. For example, in early 2015 TV5, a major French TV network was hijacked by hackers working for an Islamic terrorist group. Calling themselves CyberCaliphate, this group had apparently spent weeks getting past the formidable network security and did some major damage. TV5 satellite feeds sends programming to over 250 million households and businesses worldwide. All eleven TV5 channels were dark for three hours before a temporary data feed was established to put something on customer TV screens. It took over a week to clean the network of all the hacker malware and begin work on improving security. Other French media companies were informed of the threat and joint efforts were underway to improve security. Whatever enthusiasm there was for better security will probably not last because this was not the first time something like this has happened.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the threat was ignored or underestimated. Officially the hacker threat is taken very seriously by media companies, especially those who broadcast via satellite. Starting in the late 1990s, growing reliance on data networks and satellite distribution of programming resulted in more and more attacks on these networks by groups seeking to get some attention by briefly seizing control of or shutting down these systems.\n\nThese attacks reached something of a crescendo in 2007 when a Chinese satellite television channel was taken over by hackers. For about 90 minutes, the government had no control over the feed, which was replaced by anti-government material. The Chinese government tried to keep details of how this happened out of the news but because over 130 million Chinese then had access to the Internet, and even more had cell phones, it was impossible to completely black out details of what happened. Senior officials were quite upset, especially because since 2002 there had been over a dozen incidents worldwide of hijacking satellite television signals. Several of these took place in China, but until 2007 the government assured everyone that the problem was fixed. Eventually the problem was fixed, at least to the extent that large scale attacks no longer took place.\n\nAfter 2000 the increasing number of incidents of space satellites being hacked was believed to be largely the result of an increase in the number of satellites up there, and the number of ground stations broadcasting information up into the sky. Many of these early hacks turned out to be satellite signals interfering with one another. Same with cases where people believe their GPS or satellite communications signals were being jammed. On further investigation, the real reasons tend to be less interesting and a lot more technical. All this usually had a large element of human error mixed in. But some of the disruptions were deliberate.\n\nThe 2007 China incident clearly indicated a security problem. If you have the proper passwords and security information, you can send commands to the satellite and do whatever you want. The Chinese had a security problem and to Chinese rulers that was more frightening than, well, just about anything. China has since greatly improved its satellite security but as TV5 discovered that is not always enough. Russian EW developers watched all this with great interest and considered the possibility of improving and weaponizing these hacking capabilities.\n\nAll of the accidental jamming demonstrated to hackers how easy it was to do it on purpose. There were a growing number of examples of that. In response, the U.S. Air Force has for decades been developing electronic tools for attacking and defending satellite communications, and the satellites operators themselves were already training people to attack and defend space satellites. This effort involved figuring out new or improved ways to jam satellites. Then you keep that information secret in case potential enemies have not figured this out themselves. Next, you work on ways to defeat the weapons developed. Most of this is playing around with the signals. You can unjam a jamming signal with another signal. However, a lot of trial and error is required, and you want to get that done way in advance of any actual war. When you do have to use this work for real, you have to expect that the enemy may well have come up with some angle you missed. Thus, there will be some rapid improvisation, and you will have more time and resources for this if you have worked out, ahead of time, the details of disasters you have already anticipated. No one releases much information about this, for obvious reasons. There isn't much discussion from any government unless there is a terrorist attack using these techniques. Now that has happened in a very public fashion, and it was done using clever and determined hacking of the ground-based networks that control the programming and the satellites.\n\nSome satellite hacking problems have been solved. For example, it has been shown that if there is government jamming that could be identified as such. This was demonstrated back in 2003 and several times subsequently that when satellite broadcasters transmitting television shows to Iran found their signals being jammed. The source of the jamming was quickly traced to Cuba. A satellite signal is very difficult to jam as it comes down from the satellite. But if you are close to the ground station that beams the signal up to the satellite, you can more easily interfere with that. At first, it was thought that the Cuban government, using an old Soviet era electronic eavesdropping facility outside Havana, was doing the jamming as a favor to Iran, which bought Cuban support with supplies of cut-rate oil. Back then the Chinese had already paid Cuba a lot of money to take over and revive the old Soviet electronic monitoring facility. The Cuban government denied it had anything to do with the jamming and said it would find out where the jamming was coming from, and they did. Soon the Cuban government reported that they had traced the jamming signal to a suburban compound owned by the Iranian embassy. The Cubans ordered that jamming to be stopped, and it was.\n\nThere have been few additional efforts like this, mainly because it was obvious that you could not easily hide a jammer. Satellite broadcasters also took measures to make such jamming much more difficult to do. There were also efforts to improve defense against hackers, but for TV5 the defenses were not robust enough.\n\nRussia quietly worked on ways to not only hack satellite control and data signals but to easily eavesdrop and monitor them. Encrypted signals can be decrypted and if you can do that you do not talk about it. But now the Russian satellite signal monitoring and hacking equipment is coming out of the development shadows and practicing on American equipment."

Officials said at least 14 people were killed in the attack and the wounded are being transported to a nearby hospital. Police said some of them were listed in critical condition.\n\nLater Wednesday, another bombing at the elections office of politician Fazlur Rehman's Jamiat Ulema Islam party in Qilla Saifullah town of Baluchistan killed at least 10 people, Acahkzai and local authorities said.\n\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, which came a day before Pakistan holds parliamentary elections. Caretaker Interior Minister Gohar Ejaz denounced the bombings.\n\nThe bombing came despite the deployment of tens of thousands of police and paramilitary forces across Pakistan to ensure peace following a recent surge in militant attacks in the country, especially in Baluchistan.\n\nThe outlawed Baluchistan Liberation Army has been behind multiple attacks on security forces in Baluchistan bordering Afghanistan and Iran. On Jan. 30, a separatist Baluchistan Liberation Army group attacked security facilities in Baluchistan's Mach district, killing six people.\n\nIn recent years, Pakistan has struggled to rein in surging militancy, especially in the former stronghold of Pakistan Taliban. Militants have a presence in Baluchistan, and have targeted civilians in recent years.\n\nThe gas-rich Baluchistan province at the border of Afghanistan and Iran has been the scene of a low-level insurgency by Baluch nationalists for more than two decades. Baluch nationalists initially wanted a share of the provincial resources, but later they initiated an insurgency for independence.\n\nPakistani Taliban and other militant groups also have a strong presence in the province."

Photo courtesy of Jehovah's Witnesses\n\nFeb. 7 (UPI) -- Following nearly five years of litigation and three trials, a 49-year-old man has been sentenced by a judge in far eastern Russia to eight year's imprisonment for practicing his Jehovah's Witnesses faith.\n\nDmitriy Barmakin of Vladivostok was sentenced Tuesday in a Primorye Territory courtroom, according to his church and the Moscow-based think tank SOVA Center for Information and Analysis, making it the second time in his three trials that he has been sentenced to a penal colony, after his original sentence was overturned last April.\n\n\"Yet again, Dmitriy has been struck by the pendulum of Russia's Potemkin legal system,\" Jarrod Lopes, a spokesman for Jehovah's Witnesses, said in a statement emailed to UPI.\n\n\"Jehovah's Witnesses are neither surprised nor intimidated by Russia's systematic persecution. It's well documented in the history of Russia, as well as other lands, that the Witnesses' faith has always outlasted the persecuting regime. We expect history to repeat itself.\"\n\nRussia has been imprisoning Jehovah's Witnesses on charges related to the practicing of their faith since an April 2017 decision by its Supreme Court criminalized all activity by the Christian denomination as extremist.\n\nRussian law enforcement first arrested Barmakin on July 28, 2018, on suspicion of organizing the activities of an extremist organization over conducting Jehovah's Witnesses worship services. He spent 447 days in pre-trial detention before being released in October 2019 while his case was continuing to be investigated.\n\nThen in November 2021, Barmakin was acquitted of all charges by the Primorye Territory Court, making it the first time a Russian court had handed down a not-guilty verdict in the Kremlin's crackdown on the Jehovah's Witnesses religion.\n\nIn April of the following year, his acquittal was overturned and a new trial was ordered, following which he received his first sentence of eight years' imprisonment a year later.\n\nBarmakin then appealed the decision and a court overturned his conviction, but the case was returned to the prosecutor, who tried Barmakin a third time with the verdict in that trial being handed down Tuesday.\n\n\"Dmitriy is a hardworking, loving husband and son-in-law who has done all he could to help his family,\" Lopes said.\n\n\"It's tragically absurd that yet again he is separated from them for nothing more than a mythological narrative perpetrated by the prosecution.\"\n\nSince the religion was banned in 2017, more than 790 people have been charged for practicing their faith, including 415 who have spent time behind bars, according to a tally from the church."

    "text": "By Emilie Madi and Suleiman Al-Khalidi\n\nBEIRUT/AMMAN (Reuters) -The prospect of the U.N. agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) being forced to shut down services by the end of February is deepening despair in refugee camps across the Middle East, where it has long provided a lifeline for millions of people.\n\nIt is also causing concern in Arab states hosting the refugees, which do not have resources to fill the gap and fear any end to UNRWA would be deeply destabilising.\n\nUNRWA, which provides healthcare, education and other services, has been pitched into crisis since Israel alleged that 12 of its 13,000 staff in Gaza were involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel that precipitated the Israel-Hamas war, prompting donors to suspend funding.\n\nUNRWA hopes donors will review the suspension once a preliminary report into the assertions is published in the next several weeks.\n\nFor Palestinians, UNRWA's importance goes beyond vital services. They view its existence as enmeshed with the preservation of their rights as refugees, especially their hope of returning to homes from which they or their ancestors fled or were expelled in the war over Israel's creation in 1948.\n\nIn the Burj al-Barajneh camp on the outskirts of Beirut, Raghida al-Arbaje said she depends on UNRWA to school two of her children and cover medical bills for a third who suffers from an eye condition.\n\n\"If there is no UNRWA, I can't do any of this,\" said Arbaje, 44, adding that the agency had also paid for cancer treatment for her late husband, who died five months ago.\n\nA shanty of feebly constructed buildings and narrow alleys, Burj al-Barajneh depends on UNRWA in many ways, including programmes that offer $20 a day for labour - vital income for refugees who are barred from many jobs in Lebanon, Arbaje said.\n\nShe described the bleak situation for Palestinians in Lebanon, saying: \"We are dead even as we live.\"\n\nAppealing to donors to keep funding UNRWA, she added: \"Don't kill our hope\".\n\nRIGHT OF RETURN\n\nUNRWA - the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East - was set up in 1949 to provide refugees with vital services.\n\nToday, it serves 5.9 million Palestinians across the region.\n\nMore than half a million children are enrolled in its schools. More than 7 million visits are made each year to its clinics, according to UNRWA's website.\n\n\"The role this agency has played in protecting the rights of Palestinian refugees is fundamental,\" UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma told Reuters in an interview.\n\nUNRWA has said the allegations against the 12 staff - if true - are a betrayal of U.N. values and the people it serves.\n\nThe Hamas-led attack killed 1,200 people and abducting another 240, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, an Israeli offensive has killed more than 27,000 people in Gaza, according to health officials in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\nIsrael wants UNRWA shut down.\n\n\"It seeks to preserve the issue of Palestinian refugees. We must replace UNRWA with other U.N. agencies and other aid agencies, if we want to solve the Gaza problem as we plan to do,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Jan. 31.\n\nIn Jordan, Palestinians have held protests against any such move. \"The Destruction of UNRWA will not pass ... Yes to the right of return\", declared signs held aloft at a Feb. 2 protest in Amman.\n\nHilmi Aqel, a refugee born in the Baqa'a Palestinian refugee camp, 20 km (12 miles) north of Amman, said his UNRWA ration card \"proves that me and my children are refugees\".\n\n\"It enshrines my right.\"\n\n'CATASTROPHIC'\n\nArab states hosting the refugees have long upheld the Palestinians' right of return, rejecting any suggestion they should be resettled in the countries to which they fled in 1948.\n\nIn Lebanon, where UNRWA estimates up to 250,000 Palestinian refugees reside, the issue is infused with long-standing concerns about how the presence of the predominantly Sunni Muslim refugees affects Lebanon's sectarian balance.\n\nLebanese Social Affairs Minister Hector Hajjar said decisions by donor states to suspend aid were unfair and political, and the repercussions would be \"catastrophic\" for the Palestinians.\n\n\"If we deny the Palestinians this, what are we telling them? We are telling them to go die, or to go to extremism,\" he told Reuters in an interview. The decision would be destabilising for Lebanese, as well as Palestinians and refugees from the war in neighbouring Syria, he said.\n\nIn Jordan, the UNRWA crisis has touched on long-standing concerns. Jordan is home to some 2 million registered Palestinian refugees, most of whom have Jordanian citizenship. Officials fear any move to dismantle UNRWA would whittle away their right of return, shifting the burden onto Jordan.\n\nNorway, a donor that has not cut its funding, has said it is reasonably optimistic some countries that had paused funding would resume payments, realising the situation could not last long.\n\nThe United States has said UNRWA needs to make \"fundamental changes\" before it will resume funding.\n\nMoussa Brahim Dirawi, a refugee in Burj al-Barajneh in Beirut, expressed fear for Palestinian children were UNRWA schools forced to shut down.\n\n\"You are contributing to making a whole generation ignorant.

Officials said at least 15 people were killed in the attack and the wounded are being transported to a nearby hospital. Police said some of them were listed in critical condition.\n\nLater Wednesday, another bombing at the elections office of politician Fazlur Rehman's Jamiat Ulema Islam party in Qilla Saifullah town of Baluchistan killed at least 11 people, Acahkzai and local authorities said.\n\nJUI is one of the leading radical Islamist party and is known for backing the Afghan Taliban. JUI\u2019s religious schools are spread across the country, especially in the northwest and Baluchistan bordering Afghanistan. Many of Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban leaders studied at Islamic seminaries operated by JUI, yet Rehman and his party leaders in recent years have been attacked by the Islamic State group and other militants. Rehman and scores of candidates from his party are contesting the elections from various parts of Pakistan.\n\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, which came a day before Pakistan holds parliamentary elections.\n\nCaretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul-Haq-Kakar denounced the bombings in Baluchistan, and conveyed his condolences to the families of those who died. He vowed that \u201cevery attempt to sabotage the law and order situation will be thwarted.\u201d\n\nKakar said the government is committed to holding elections in a peaceful environment.\n\nCaretaker Interior Minister Gohar Ejaz also denounced the bombings, saying no one would be allowed to sabotage the election process.\n\nThe bombings came despite the deployment of tens of thousands of police and paramilitary forces across Pakistan to ensure peace following a recent surge in militant attacks in the country, especially in Baluchistan.\n\nThe outlawed Baluchistan Liberation Army has been behind multiple attacks on security forces, including a Jan. 30 attack on security facilities that killed six people.\n\nIn recent years, Pakistan has struggled to rein in surging militancy. Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups also have a strong presence in the Baluchistan province and have targeted civilians in recent years.\n\nThe gas-rich province at the border of Afghanistan and Iran has been the scene of a low-level insurgency by Baluch nationalists for more than two decades. Baluch nationalists initially wanted a share of the provincial resources, but later they initiated an insurgency for independence.\n\nViolence ahead of elections and on the day of polling is common in Pakistan. In one of the worst such attacks, Pakistan\u2019s two-time former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack in 2007, just minutes after she addressed an election rally in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. Her son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, led the campaign for her Pakistan People\u2019s Party until Tuesday night amid tight security.\n\n___\n\nAhmed reported from Islamabad.\n\nAbdul Sattar And Munir Ahmed, The Associated Press"

    "text": "Russia is facing a financial crisis because its main export item, petroleum, has declined in value while Russia, because of sanctions, has more difficulty getting cut-rate petroleum to buyers. For example, in the second half of 2023, Russian oil income hit a record low of $14.4 billion while the control over oil prices of OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, had started to unravel after 64 years of controlling the oil market. A growing number of new oil exporters do not join OPEC. This further degrades OPEC\u2019s ability to control oil prices and keep them high.\n\nEconomic sanctions imposed on Russia for invading Ukraine have also made it difficult for Russia to deliver oil to customers, so Russia then cut its oil prices. This made the illegal Russian oil imports attractive because it protected the importer against losses from sanctioned shipments that were detected and blocked by one or more of the many nations supporting the sanctions. At the same time OPEC has been losing its ability to control oil production because of the increasing number of new oil exporting nations that did not join OPEC and sell their oil on the open market for whatever they can get. This trend is overwhelming OPEC\u2019s ability to control prices and reduces Russian oil income more each year. This is all part of a growing assortment of economic problems imposed on Russia. Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, Western countries united in imposing severe economic sanctions on Russia. This did some damage to the Russian economy, but not as much as the sanctioning countries expected. This is because there are always other countries with current or previous experience evading sanctions. Outlaw states tend to cooperate, or at least share sanction evasion techniques with each other. Russia found that nearby Iran, which has been under varying degrees of sanctions for decades, was a good source of advice on evading sanctions. Even before Russia went total outlaw in Ukraine, they had been cooperating with Iran, North Korea, and several other heavily sanctioned nations.\n\nRussian oil exports, which for decades have been about eight million BPD or Barrels Per Day, vary in value depending on the world price for oil. In the last decade there have been two instances of sanctions related declines in Russian oil exports. The first was in 2014, in response to the Russian occupation of Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine. Russian oil exports fell about ten percent from their normal level. Russian oil exports recovered quickly to their previous levels, but oil income remained lower because Russia had to use discounts to get past the oil sanctions. This was because nations caught obtaining sanctioned oil could themselves be sanctioned. In 2022, Russia was hit with even heavier sanctions that caused oil income for 2022 to decline by over 20 percent compared to the previous year.\n\nRussian oil exports cannot be ignored because Russia is the second largest oil exporter, behind Saudi Arabia. During periods when Russian oil exports are sanctioned, the primary impact is Russia receiving less for its oil. Russia managed to quickly deal with the new sanctions because of its close relationships with Iran, which was a veteran practitioner of how best to evade sanctions.\n\nIran has become quite skilled at evading sanctions. Since the U.S. revived economic sanctions against Iran in 2017, there has been an even larger and better organized effort to defeat the many methods Iran has developed over the years to conceal its smuggling efforts. Everyone involved tried to keep details of these Iranian schemes and American countermeasures out of the news, and not just because the Iranian methods were usually illegal, but also because the U.S. and its allies didn\u2019t want Iran to know the full extent of the new countermeasures being used. That veil of secrecy began to shred at the start of 2019 when a storm off the Syrian coast ran an Indian tanker, the Tour 2, ashore. The tanker had just delivered Iranian oil to Syria and went to sea hurriedly using the bad weather to evade detection. Tugs did not arrive until April to pull the tanker off the beach near the Syrian port of Latakia. It soon became clear what happened here. During late December 2018, Tour 2 loaded its oil cargo in an Iranian port and after it exited the Suez Canal it ghosted or ran dark. That is, the tanker turned off its AIS Automated Identification System, which allows ship owners and their customers, as well as any nearby vessels, to track the progress of large ships. With the Indian shipping company exposed as illegally smuggling oil to Syria, the extent of the increased American scrutiny of ships making deliveries to Syria forced Iran to be more resourceful. Iranian plans for more illegal oil tanker visits to Syria had to be hastily revised. Iran found that most of its old ploys and too many of its new schemes to carry out illegal oil movements no longer worked, at least not regularly. For months after the Tour 2 grounding, there was a very visible oil shortage in most of Syria. Iran has resorted to smuggling oil via truck from Iran through Iraq to Syria, but this is not sufficient to make up for the deliveries via sea going tankers.\n\nIran also noted that the American/Israeli surveillance of economic activity in Syria was more thorough and robust than anticipated. Any improvement in the Syrian oil situation triggered more international countermoves to block Iranian efforts to find a tanker that could deliver to Syria. The new countermeasures include monitoring the nations that provide ship registry services while maritime insurance companies have their own array of regulations regarding who can have access to insurance coverage and who cannot. This is about more than ship owners being covered against accidents at sea or in port. Ships without proper coverage, especially for vessels carrying dangerous cargo, like petroleum and natural gas, cannot enter many major ports or the territorial waters of most nations if they do not have proper insurance. By mid-2019 Iran found it more difficult to conceal what its hundred or so Iranian owned tankers and cargo ships were doing as more and more shipping companies and nations refused to do business with Iran. Iran tried to rely on Chinese tankers using Iranian techniques. For example, a Chinese tanker in the Indian Ocean using ghosting and, while its AIS was off, changed its ship registration to hide delivery of Iranian oil to a banned customer. Now the Americans are threatening to seize Chinese tankers if China does not enforce the terms of the Iranian sanctions.\n\nAll this is happening because once more Iranian oil exports are hobbled by sanctions and Iran is reviving its usual array of deceptions to try and hide illegal exports to customers willing to risk discovery and punishment when the Iranian deceptions fail. The last time Iran got hit by an oil export ban, shipments dropped from 2.6 million barrels per day to a million barrels per day. After the sanctions were once more imposed in late 2018, Iranian exports quickly fell from 2.8 million barrels per day to 1.8 million barrels. By April 2019 legal shipments had declined to under a million barrels per day. By mid-2019 oil shipments were often down to less than half a million barrels a day. The decline delay was, in part, caused by exemptions given to eight export customers who needed time to shift to another supplier. Some of the exemptions are permanent which is why the exports never hit zero.\n\nThere are plenty of other suppliers because there has been a world oil glut since 2010 because of fracking in North America and elsewhere. The OPEC oil cartel has restricted production to try and drive the oil price up, but that only worked for a while and only partially. Even before Iranian oil sanctions were revived the oil price was declining again. There were plenty of oil producers willing and able to replace Iranian exports. Illegal Iranian oil exports are sold at a lower price because of the risk of financial costs if caught and that also contributes to keeping oil prices low. But if scrutiny is too intense the smugglers find they cannot reach many customers. By mid-2019 Iran was again threatening to close the entrance to the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and the Red Sea entrance as well. The Hormuz threats were a bluff because Iran would be hurt more than anyone else, in the short term as well as going forward. A more immediate problem was Iran losing the cloak of secrecy that had long kept its smuggling methods out of the news.\n\nIran not only revived its usual techniques to hide ship movements but was shown to have expanded them. One reason the oil sanctions returned was that after most sanctions were lifted in 2015 is that Iran continued to smuggle weapons by sea, using the same deceptions it employed to try and get around the oil export ban. The difference was that most of the ships Iran used for arms smuggling were under 300 tons and not legally required to carry an electronic beacon. But some larger Iranian weapons smuggling ships illegally turned off their AIS beacon and, as the saying goes, ghosted. It was this continued smuggling and other unfriendly activity that brought back the sanctions and the oil embargo.\n\nIran now found that its opponents, mainly the U.S. and Israel, developed more effective methods of tracking its use of smaller ships so those were no longer as successful. Other old standbys, like bribes and corruption of officials involved in monitoring maritime cargo in ports and at sea, were also under greater scrutiny.\n\nFor a long time, the primary technical deception was having ships carrying contraband turn off their AIS transponder. AIS was originally developed to make it easier to track ships at sea and was rapidly adopted by most large commercial vessels in the 1990s. AIS is essentially an automatic transponder or radio beacon that, when it receives a signal from a nearby AIS equipped ship, responds with the ship's identity, course, and speed. This is meant to enable AIS ships to avoid collisions with each other. The original AIS only had a range of 20-35 kilometers but by 2006 space satellites were developed that could track AIS transmissions worldwide. Commercial ships have become very dependent on AIS, which has greatly reduced collisions and crew anxiety at sea. After 2000 international agreements mandated that ships larger than 300 tons, and all passenger ships carry and use AIS at all times.\n\nWhile this made it practical to track all high seas commercial traffic, it was also exploited by smugglers and pirates. Some ships traveled in violation of international law with AIS and other trackers turned off. Usually, only criminals turned these devices off, and this was often discovered when navies spotted one of these ships ghosting at sea. It didn\u2019t take long for some intelligence agencies, at least those with ocean surveillance space satellites and lots of ships and subs at sea, to exploit the silent AIS ploy to create better ways to track smugglers by noting when some ships turn off their trackers and then turn them on again as they are about to enter a port or some other area where AIS use is mandatory. Some nations, like Iran and North Korea, have tankers and cargo ships that are often found running dark. Naturally, intelligence agencies developed methods to take advantage of this and a growing number of smugglers, usually North Korean, are detected and tracked because of AIS manipulation. Iran had an easier time concealing arms smuggling because they could use smaller ships. Actually, for getting arms to Shia rebels in Yemen Iran used a lot of small ships that are not required to use AIS. These could be, and were, tracked by satellite but it was more difficult. Oil smuggling is another matter as large ships, especially tankers, are used and they are easier to spot from orbital space or by recon aircraft and UAVs.\n\nAIS monitoring has been combined with analyzing the thousands of satellite photos available each day from commercial satellites. Using software that can scan these digital photos and match ship position data with current AIS data, it is easier to identify who is misbehaving and go after them. This has been bad news for Iranian oil smuggling efforts and so far, the Iranians have not come up with effective countermeasures.\n\nBefore AIS came along, most large ships carried, and still carry INMARSAT, which enables shipping companies to keep track of their vessels no matter where they are on the planet. INMARSAT became available in the 1980s and uses a system of satellites which transmit AIS-like signals to anywhere on the oceans. It only costs a few cents to send an INMARSAT signal to one of your ships, and a few cents more to receive a reply. The trackers and satellite-based navigation systems in general soon proved invaluable by preventing collisions or running into reefs, rocks, or when there is bad weather, near coastal areas.\n\nThe smugglers soon responded to intel agency tracking of AIS activity with new tricks. Back in 2012, Iran was caught hacking AIS signals. Iran was sending false AIS signals to assist its smuggling operations. After 2012 security researchers found even more ways to hack AIS and have been calling for changes in the AIS software to make it more difficult to spoof. Iran is expected to try this again, despite the increased security measures in the AIS software.\n\nIran has been working for some time to come up with ways to confuse the international ship tracking system, mainly to support their arms smuggling activities. These maritime security technologies were developed as a safety feature and have proved valuable in other ways as well by providing the positions of ships caught in storms or taken by pirates. All ships now use GPS coordinates to record location and constantly report that back to the home office. Iran exploited this by having two of its ships trade INMARSAT IDs while they were near each other, leaving the U.S., or anyone else checking INMARSAT data, unable to track ships that have been switched. Well, for a while at least. Once the intel people caught onto this scam, they developed ways to counter it. This is very much a matter of move and counter move when it comes to exploiting or creating AIS vulnerabilities.\n\nBecause these tracking systems were, after 2000, required by international agreements for all seagoing vessels, this new tech was particularly useful in counter-terror operations. Coast guards the world over have also found the systems a big help. But apparently pirates in some areas have gained access to the systems via bribes or theft and a large number of pirate attacks appear to have been helped by technology meant to safeguard ships at sea. But overall, the tracking systems have done far more good than bad. By 2012 counter-piracy operations improved and better security inside the AIS operation made it much more difficult to be a pirate via stolen AIS data.\n\nIranian abuse of the AIS system was not appreciated by the shipping companies and ship crews. The Iranians have been found moving tankers around the Persian Gulf with AIS turned off. The Iranians do this in other parts of the world where there is a lot of ship traffic. This puts ships of many nations at risk and despite Iranian denials, there are enough ships reporting encounters with Iranian ships running dark to confirm what Iran is doing. All this outlaw activity turned more and more former allies, or neutrals, against Iran.\n\nThe bad reputation Iran has made for itself in the maritime shipping community caught up with them in 2019. Nations that registered ships, the flags of convenience, were no longer as convenient for Iran and the Iranians were surprised to find out how many ship registering nations, even the small ones with a reputation for serving shady customers, were no longer willing to register Iranian ships and were able to spot, with American help, Iranian efforts to use deception to get one of their ships registered. Insurance companies work closely with ship registrars to spot fraudulent activities and Iran soon found many of its ships could not get insurance and without it could not enter many foreign ports. At this point, Iran finds itself on the defensive. The Americans had built up a larger arsenal of countermeasures than Iran expected, and that disturbing revelation came at a very inconvenient time.\n\nBecause Russian oil exports represented a larger portion of oil exports, Russia found more major oil purchasers willing to cooperate in evading sanctions for the discounted Russian oil. Iran was also a major supplier of munitions to Russia after Ukraine was invaded and Russia found it needed more ammunition than expected. Russia expected a short war. This is a common delusion with aggressor states and now Russia finds itself taking major losses in Ukraine and unable to find an easy way out."
