    "message": "Along with the United States, several countries have listed Hamas as a terrorist organization. The group considers itself a liberation movement for Palestinians against Israeli occupation.\n\nThe U.S. has designated Hamas as a terrorist organization three times, says Matthew Levitt, a specialist on Hamas at the Washington Institute of Near East Policy.\n\n\u201cThe first time predates the current terrorism lists and came in the process of the peace process under the Clinton administration in 1995,\u201d he said. The Clinton White House had an executive order, a law banning groups that were threatening the peace process. That included Islamist groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and also Jewish extremist groups like Kach and Kahane Chai.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, the U.S. created a new terrorism list.\n\n\u201cThen in 1997, the State Department initiated its Foreign Terrorist Organization or FTO list, which is specific to terrorist groups,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cAnd Hamas was added to that list because of the acts of terrorism it was conducting not only because it was threatening the peace process but it was at that point carrying out shooting attacks, stabbing attacks and beginning to carry out suicide bombings quite frequently as well.\u201d\n\nThe third time, according to Levitt, came after 9/11 attacks on the U.S. when the Bush administration created a special global terrorism list.\n\nLevitt explained how Hamas fits the definition of a terrorist organization.\n\n\u201cThe simple, most basic definition is targeting civilians for the purpose of effecting social or political change,\u201d he said. \"Personally, I simplify it a little bit more: It\u2019s about the tactic. Terrorism is a tactic and if you engage in this tactic of targeting civilians for the purpose of effecting social and political change then that act is an act of terrorism.\u201d\n\nIn its 1988 manifesto, Hamas called for the destruction of Israel. Years later, in 2017, Hamas dropped that language.\n\nBut it continued to incessantly fire rockets into Israeli communities.\n\nOn October 7, thousands of Hamas gunmen stormed into Israel killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli tallies, and took over more than 20 Israeli kibbutzim and other communities. Among the dead were at least 30 Israelis who also had U.S. citizenship.\n\nIsrael responded to the Hamas attack with a war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 27,000 Palestinians have been killed, although that includes both fighters and civilians. Israel says it has killed an estimated 10,000 Hamas fighters, about one third of Hamas\u2019s total force.\n\nIsrael says its forces in Gaza are carrying out precision attacks and are not targeting civilians. It says civilian deaths that are occurring are unintentional.\n\nThe growing civilian death toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza have led to growing international pressure on Israel to stop the war. The U.S. says that Gaza must eventually be run by a revitalized Palestinian Authority, an idea that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected.\n\nHamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, is rejecting it too. In a recent interview with a Kuwaiti journalist, former Hamas senior official Khaled Mashaal, who lives in Qatar, rejected the idea of recognizing Israel, and said that the October 7 attack proved that the idea of liberating Palestine \u201cfrom the river to the sea\u201d is realistic.\n\nMashaal said Hamas has used its rule of Gaza to build up the resistance and all its means. He said the weapons, the weapons production, the planning, the training and the tunnels were built, keeping their backs safe.\n\nThere are 2.3 million civilians living in Gaza, an enclave just 25 miles long.\n\nIsraeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari says Hamas has hidden its fighters in civilian infrastructure.\n\n\u201cHamas uses hospitals as terror infrastructures,\u201d he said. \u201cHamas has turned hospitals into command-and-control centers and hideouts for Hamas terrorists and commanders.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is committed to destroying Hamas as a military power. But four months into the war, Hamas remains in control in parts of Gaza, making it unclear what the future of the enclave will be."

    "message": "February 7, 2024 \u2014 Baghdad (AFP)\n\nIraq on Thursday condemned a US air strike that killed a senior commander from a pro-Iran armed group accused of having been involved in attacks on American troops in the region.\n\nThe US attack on Wednesday came after a wave of strikes on Iran-linked targets in Iraq and Syria last week following the killing of three American troops in neighbouring Jordan on January 28.\n\nThe US Central Command (CENTCOM) said the commander killed Wednesday was targeted \"in response to the attacks on US service members\".\n\nThe strike killed \"a Kataeb Hezbollah commander responsible for directly planning and participating in attacks on US forces in the region,\" according to CENTCOM.\n\nIraqi authorities slammed the strike as a \"blatant assassination\" in a residential neighbourhood of Baghdad.\n\n\"The international coalition is completely overstepping the reasons and objectives for which it is present on our territory,\" said Yehia Rasool, the military spokesman for Iraq's prime minister.\n\nHe was referring to the US-led military coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State group -- the year the jihadist group overran nearly a third of Iraq's territory.\n\nRasool later announced in a statement that talks with Washington on the \"end of the mission\" would resume on Sunday.\n\nA first round of talks opened on January 27 following a request by Iraqi Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani for a timetable for the withdrawal of US-led troops.\n\nIt was swiftly suspended after the deadly drone strike in Jordan the following day.\n\nKataeb Hezbollah -- which announced it was suspending its operations against US forces after the Jordan attack -- said one of its commanders had been killed, identifying him as Abu Baqr al-Saadi.\n\nThe commander, whose funeral was held on Thursday, was responsible for \"military affairs\" in Syria, an official from the group told AFP.\n\nAn interior ministry official said a total of three people -- two Kataeb Hezbollah leaders and their driver -- had died in the strike, which was carried out by a drone in the east Baghdad neighbourhood of Mashtal.\n\n- 'Red lines' -\n\nThe latest US strike sparked condemnation in Iraq, with a pro-Iran parliamentary bloc dubbing it an attack on \"Iraqi sovereignty\".\n\nWashington has \"crossed all red lines by targeting regular forces and men who contributed to defeating Islamic State terrorism,\" said the Coordination Framework, an alliance of pro-Iran Shiite parties.\n\nIraq's pro-Iran Al-Nujaba movement promised a \"targeted retaliation\", saying that \"these crimes will not go unpunished\".\n\nIran joined in the condemnation on Thursday, with foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani calling the strike an act of \"adventurism\" that was \"a threat to regional and international peace and stability\".\n\nUS and allied troops have been targeted more than 165 times in the Middle East since mid-October in attacks linked to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe majority of the attacks have been claimed by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups angered by US support for Israel.\n\nIraq analyst Sajad Jiyad, of the New York-based Century Foundation think tank, said he expected the tensions to continue to spiral.\n\n\"These groups have a lot of capabilities, they are active in several countries now, the US is willing to engage, to retaliate, to kill members of these groups,\" he said.\n\n\"The US is giving no indication it is going to pull back or stand down its military activity in the Middle East,\" he said, adding \"it is very difficult to suddenly see an end to the tensions.\"\n\nWashington has some 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 in Iraq as part of the coalition against IS.\n\nIts troops in Iraq are deployed at the invitation of Baghdad, but those in Syria are located in areas outside Syrian government control."

The Sky News team left when a man \u201cwarned us we needed to leave the area after telling us parts of the crowd wanted to attack us and our vehicle\u201d:\n\nU.S. Central Command announced on Wednesday that it had taken action, \u201ckilling a Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah commander responsible for directly planning and participating in attacks on U.S. forces in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no indications of collateral damage or civilian casualties at this time,\u201d the U.S. military statement read. \u201cThe United States will continue to take necessary action to protect our people.

One other man killed in the strike was later identified as Arkan Alyawi. U.S. authorities said the strike was a response to Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah and similar Iran-backed groups in the region engaging in dozens of attacks on U.S. troops since October 7, when the genocidal jihadist group Hamas invaded Israel and massacred 1,200 people, in addition to engaging in acts of gang rape, infanticide, torture, and other atrocities.\n\nOne of those attacks, in late January, killed three American servicemembers. The \u201cIslamic Resistance in Iraq,\u201d a name used by several jihadist groups in the region, including Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, took responsibility for the killings.\n\nKata\u2019ib Hezbollah, or the Hezbollah Brigades, is a Shiite, U.S.-designated terrorist organization with close ties to Iran. It is part of the \u201cPopular Mobilization Forces\u201d (PMF), a coalition of similar militias that the government of Iraq formally integrated into its armed forces during the fight to liberate Iraq and Syria from the Sunni Islamic State \u201ccaliphate.\u201d Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah and similar groups claim credit for eradicating the Islamic State, though most of the effort was undertaken by Kurdish Peshmerga and Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) troops with the aid of American allies.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Islamic State \u201ccaliphate,\u201d the PMF began targeting Kurdish and American forces. In response, under former President Donald Trump, U.S. forces eliminated the founder and leader of Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, in a drone strike in Iraq in January 2020. That strike also killed the head of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, Tehran\u2019s top terror mastermind. The strikes largely neutralized the Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah threat, though the terrorists have regrouped under current President Joe Biden.\n\nIn late January, Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah issued a statement promising that its terrorists would execute \u201cpainful attacks on US occupation forces until they are driven out of Iraq and the region.\u201d Days later, it issued a bizarre missive claiming that it would stop \u201cembarrassing\u201d the government of Iraq by targeting Americans.\n\nKata\u2019ib Hezbollah confirmed the loss of several of its top terrorists on Thursday in a statement in which it \u201cextended congratulations\u201d to the families of those killed for their \u201cmartyrdom.\u201d\n\nSecretary-General of Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi declared that the drone strike \u201ccalls us to remain steadfast in the jihadist approach.\u201d\n\nThe government of Iraq responded to the American strike with outrage, as the PMF and its terrorist members are formally the Iraqi military.\n\n\u201cAny kind of military attack on the Iraqi territory is unacceptable,\u201d Prime Minister Mohammed Shia\u2019 al-Sudani proclaimed, with an outrage notably absent when Iranian forces conduct operations in Iraq. Sudani, for example, had no meaningful response to the IRGC bombing Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, and killing a baby ten days shy of her first birthday in mid-January. The IRGC claimed that it had bombed a \u201cMossad base;\u201d in reality, it destroyed the home of a local businessman, killing him and his daughter and injuring several other family members.\n\nYahya Rasool, an Iraqi military spokesman, demanded America withdraw from Iraq completely.\n\n\u201cThe international coalition is completely overstepping the reasons and objectives for which it is present on our territory,\u201d he said in a statement following Wednesday\u2019s strike. \u201cThis path pushes the Iraqi government more than ever before to end the coalition\u2019s mission which has become a factor of instability for Iraq.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."

Security Council that was initiated by Russia to address the strike, Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused Washington of being an accomplice in what Moscow has termed an \"act of terrorism.\"\n\nNebenzia did not offer any evidence to back up his claim. When reached for comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Newsweek: \"We hope people see this false narrative for what it is\u2014standard Kremlin nonsense.\"\n\nAccording to Russia's emergencies ministry, at least 28 people were killed on Saturday when a bakery in the Russian-occupied city of Lysychansk in Ukraine's Luhansk region of Donbas was shelled. Russian publication RTVI reported that the strike was likely carried out by Ukraine using a U.S.-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), though Newsweek couldn't independently verify which weapons were used in the attack.

Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, speaks during a U.N. Security Council at U.N. headquarters in New York City on August 24, 2023. On Tuesday, Nebenzia accused the U.S. of being partially responsible for a strike on a Russian-occupied city, claiming American intelligence is notified in advance of such attacks. More Photo by YUKI IWAMURA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAmong those killed was Alexey Poteleshchenko, who served as the Kremlin-installed minister of emergency situations in the region. Eduard Sakhnenko, Kremlin's designated mayor of Lysychansk, also reported two municipal deputies were killed in the attack.\n\n\"If someone undertakes to argue that Western countries have nothing to do with it and that Kyiv picks its own targets for strikes, they should be reminded of the confession of Vadym Skibitsky, a representative of the defense intelligence of Ukraine,\" Nebenzia said on Tuesday, according to Russian state-controlled media outlet RT.\n\nSkibitsky is the deputy head of Ukraine's defense intelligence, and Nebenzia was referencing an August 2022 interview he gave to the U.K.'s Telegraph. The newspaper paraphrased Skibitsky as reportedly saying that before Ukraine launches a strike, Washington is notified first and can veto any potential attacks.\n\n\"So it is quite obvious who was involved in the Lysychansk attack,\" the Russian envoy said, per RT.\n\nHowever, the American envoy to the U.N. pushed back on Nebenzia's characterization of the bakery incident during the U.N. Security Council meeting.\n\n\"We have seen the news reports of a strike hitting a bakery in Russia-occupied eastern Ukraine with at least 28 killed on February 3,\" Robert Wood, U.S. deputy ambassador, said. \"While we are unable to independently verify that information, the United States laments all civilian casualties and expresses its sincerest condolences to the families of any civilians killed.\"\n\nWood added: \"To be clear: Russia is the only aggressor in this war and the only one that could end this war today.\""

Santiago / Getty Images / AFP\n\nSkibitsky admitted that in order to use the HIMARS systems, Kiev must first obtain target clearance from Washington.\n\nWashington is partially responsible for Ukraine's missile strike on a bakery in the city of Lisichansk in Russia's Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) last week that killed over two dozen civilians, Moscow's permanent envoy to the UN Vassily Nebenzia stated on Tuesday.On February 3, the Armed Forces of Ukraine used high-power precision weaponry, presumably US-supplied HIMARS missiles, to target the bakery. The attack almost completely destroyed the two-story building and left some 40 people buried in the rubble, according to Nebenzia. Some 28 civilians died in the strike, including a pregnant woman and her five-year-old child. LPR Minister of Emergency Situations Aleksey Poteleschenko was among those killed in the attack.Speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council initiated by Russia in response to the strike, Nebenzia stressed thatthe diplomat said.Nebenzia recalled that in August 2022,the ambassador said. This also applies to the \"dozens if not hundreds\" of other crimes committed by Kiev using Western weapons, such as the recent downing of a Russian Il-76 aircraft carrying Ukrainian POWs, he added.The diplomat also pointed out that the time and place of Kiev's attack on Lisichansk were chosen deliberately, as Ukraine's forces were aware that there are not many recreational places left in the city. \"The neo-Nazis deliberately waited for the moment when families went for a walk on their day off, and cynically attacked almost the only place of leisure in Lisichansk,\" Nebenzia said.\u0422he Russian envoy reiterated calls on the members of the UN Security Council and the UN leadership to \"strongly condemn the attack on Lisichansk and all other terrorist acts by the Kiev regime.\"\"The Bandera junta views your silence as a carte blanche to commit more crimes. For our part, we confirm that all those involved - the organizers and the perpetrators of this crime - will be identified and held accountable,\" Nebenzia added. Russia will achieve its goals of demilitarizing and denazifying Ukraine through either diplomatic or military means, he insisted."

The U.S., in response, has struck back about a half dozen times since Oct. 27, targeting weapons storage sites, command and control centers, training facilities and other locations used by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iranian-backed groups, including Kataib Hezbollah.\n\nWednesday's U.S. strike in Iraq's capital drew comparisons to the 2020 drone strike in Baghdad that killed Iran's Quds Force leader Gen. Qassem Soleimani, in response to attacks on U.S. bases there and an assault on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. That bombing also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces.

The terrorists would release the hostages in three stages along with Palestinian prisoners in Israel:\n\nPhase one: A 45-day pause in fighting during which all Israeli women hostages, males under 19, the elderly and sick would be exchanged for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza, and the reconstruction of hospitals and refugee camps would begin.\n\nA 45-day pause in fighting during which all Israeli women hostages, males under 19, the elderly and sick would be exchanged for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza, and the reconstruction of hospitals and refugee camps would begin. Phase two: Remaining male Israeli hostages would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and Israeli forces leave Gaza completely.\n\nRemaining male Israeli hostages would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and Israeli forces leave Gaza completely. Phase three: Both sides would exchange remains and bodies. The proposed deal would also see deliveries of food and other aid to Gaza increase. By the end of the 135-day pause in fighting, Hamas said negotiations to end the war would have concluded.\n\nThe prisoners, including the women and children, are in prison because they tried to attack Israel. Yes, women and children can be terrorists.\n\nReleasing prisoners would be a mistake. Look at Hamas leader Sinwar, a former Israeli prisoner exchanged for one Israeli soldier.\n\nIsrael learned her lesson:\n\nSpeaking with reporters during a press conference in Jerusalem, Netanyahu insisted that he had made no specific promises regarding the release of Palestinian security prisoners with blood on their hands, or any ratio for Palestinian prisoners to be freed in return for hostages in a potential deal, declaring that Israel \u201chas not committed to anything.\u201d \u201cThere is supposed to be some kind of negotiation via the intermediaries. But right now, given what I see from the response by Hamas [to the Israel-backed framework for talks on a deal], they\u2019re not there,\u201d he said. \u201cSurrender to Hamas\u2019s delusional demands, that we\u2019ve just heard, not only would not bring about the freedom of the hostages, but it would only invite an additional slaughter; it would invite disaster for Israel that no Israeli citizens want,\u201d he said.\n\nNetanyahu has felt pressure from the loved ones of the hostages, released hostages, and others around the world to take deals to bring them home.\n\nNetanyahu and the IDF know the best way to preserve Israel is to eliminate Hamas:\n\n\u201cThe victory is within reach,\u201d he stated, predicting that the war would be won in a \u201cmatter of months\u201d rather than years or decades. Netanyahu\u2019s comments echoed those of IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who said on Tuesday during a visit to northern Gaza that the hostages\u2019 return \u201cwon\u2019t happen without military pressure.\u201d Calling the military\u2019s accomplishments in the offensive against Hamas \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Netanyahu said that 20,000 Hamas fighters are dead or injured \u2014 more than half the Hamas fighting force, with 18 of its 24 battalions no longer functional.

Abed Rahim Khatib/dpa\n\nAccording to Israeli and Palestinian reports, three Palestinians were killed during an army operation in the West Bank on Wednesday.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said one of the men was suspected of being involved in terrorist activities. According to the Israeli military, they wanted to arrest him, and had surrounded his house in the Nur Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm city in the north-western West Bank.\n\nThe other two people killed had tried to escape from the building. The military's claims could not initially be independently verified.\n\nThe IDF also fired rockets at the house, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah. The authorities reported two deaths.\n\nThe armed wing of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party in the West Bank said that the three victims were members of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. One of the men is said to have been a commander.\n\nA general strike was called in Tulkarm on Thursday.\n\nThe situation in the West Bank has worsened significantly since the start of the war between Israel and the the Palestinian militant organization Hamas in the Gaza Strip on October 7.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, around 370 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since then. More than 60 Palestinians have been killed in West Bank confrontations with the Israeli military or militant Israeli settlers since the beginning of the year.\n\nIsrael took control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War. Hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers now live there, surrounded by around 3 million Palestinians, who have Western backing to form their own state in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\nMeanwhile, fierce fighting and renewed attacks by Israel in the south of the Gaza Strip continued.\n\nThe Israeli army said on Wednesday that \"armed terrorist cells\" had been eliminated and numerous weapons had been seized. It went on to say that paratroopers had \"killed dozens of terrorists in Khan Younis over the past 24 hours.\"\n\nIn one incident in the west of Khan Younis, soldiers encountered three gunmen who fired anti-tank missiles at them. The three men and \"several other terror operatives\" were killed in close-quarter combat.\n\nHamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, also described an attack on Israeli soldiers in the west of Khan Younis on Wednesday.\n\nThe United Nations expressed concern about the fate of the civilian population as Israeli ground troops advanced towards the city of Rafah, which lies on the border with Egypt.\n\n\"Their living conditions are abysmal \u2014 they lack the basic necessities to survive, stalked by hunger, disease and death,\" said UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths in Geneva on Wednesday evening.\n\nAccording to UN figures, more than 1 million people are now living in cramped conditions in the city in the south of the Gaza Strip. That is four times as many as before the Gaza war started on October 7.\n\nThe war was triggered by the worst massacre in Israel's history, carried out by fighters from Hamas and other extremist Palestinian organizations on October 7 in Israel near the border with the Gaza Strip. More than 1,200 people were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael responded with massive airstrikes and a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAccording to Palestinian figures, more than 27,500 people have died in the Gaza Strip since then, Griffiths said. Further fighting in Rafah would cost even more lives. It would also make the already difficult humanitarian aid operations more difficult.\n\n\"To put it simply: This war must stop.\"\n\nPalestinian children look on as they stand by rubble and debris of destroyed houses and vehicles in the aftermath of an Israeli bombardment, amid the ongoing battles between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

    "message": "By VOA\n\nBy Linda Gradstein\n\nAlong with the United States, several countries have listed Hamas as a terrorist organization. The group considers itself a liberation movement for Palestinians against Israeli occupation.\n\nThe U.S. has designated Hamas as a terrorist organization three times, says Matthew Levitt, a specialist on Hamas at the Washington Institute of Near East Policy.\n\n\u201cThe first time predates the current terrorism lists and came in the process of the peace process under the Clinton administration in 1995,\u201d he said. The Clinton White House had an executive order, a law banning groups that were threatening the peace process. That included Islamist groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and also Jewish extremist groups like Kach and Kahane Chai.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, the U.S. created a new terrorism list.\n\n\u201cThen in 1997, the State Department initiated its Foreign Terrorist Organization or FTO list, which is specific to terrorist groups,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cAnd Hamas was added to that list because of the acts of terrorism it was conducting not only because it was threatening the peace process but it was at that point carrying out shooting attacks, stabbing attacks and beginning to carry out suicide bombings quite frequently as well.\u201d\n\nThe third time, according to Levitt, came after 9/11 attacks on the U.S. when the Bush administration created a special global terrorism list.\n\nLevitt explained how Hamas fits the definition of a terrorist organization.\n\n\u201cThe simple, most basic definition is targeting civilians for the purpose of effecting social or political change,\u201d he said. Personally, I simplify it a little bit more: It\u2019s about the tactic. Terrorism is a tactic and if you engage in this tactic of targeting civilians for the purpose of effecting social and political change then that act is an act of terrorism.\u201d\n\nIn its 1988 manifesto, Hamas called for the destruction of Israel. Years later, in 2017, Hamas dropped that language.\n\nBut it continued to incessantly fire rockets into Israeli communities.\n\nOn October 7, thousands of Hamas gunmen stormed into Israel killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli tallies, and took over more than 20 Israeli kibbutzim and other communities. Among the dead were at least 30 Israelis who also had U.S. citizenship.\n\nIsrael responded to the Hamas attack with a war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 27,000 Palestinians have been killed, although that includes both fighters and civilians. Israel says it has killed an estimated 10,000 Hamas fighters, about one third of Hamas\u2019s total force.\n\nIsrael says its forces in Gaza are carrying out precision attacks and are not targeting civilians. It says civilian deaths that are occurring are unintentional.\n\nThe growing civilian death toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza have led to growing international pressure on Israel to stop the war. The U.S. says that Gaza must eventually be run by a revitalized Palestinian Authority, an idea that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected.\n\nHamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, is rejecting it too. In a recent interview with a Kuwaiti journalist, former Hamas senior official Khaled Mashaal, who lives in Qatar, rejected the idea of recognizing Israel, and said that the October 7 attack proved that the idea of liberating Palestine \u201cfrom the river to the sea\u201d is realistic.\n\nMashaal said Hamas has used its rule of Gaza to build up the resistance and all its means. He said the weapons, the weapons production, the planning, the training and the tunnels were built, keeping their backs safe.\n\nThere are 2.3 million civilians living in Gaza, an enclave just 25 miles long.\n\nIsraeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari says Hamas has hidden its fighters in civilian infrastructure.\n\n\u201cHamas uses hospitals as terror infrastructures,\u201d he said. \u201cHamas has turned hospitals into command-and-control centers and hideouts for Hamas terrorists and commanders.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is committed to destroying Hamas as a military power. But four months into the war, Hamas remains in control in parts of Gaza, making it unclear what the future of the enclave will be"

    "message": "By Qassim Abdul-Zahra, Lolita C. Baldor and Aamer Madhani | Associated Press\n\nBAGHDAD \u2014 A U.S. drone strike blew up a car in the Iraqi capital Wednesday night, killing a high-ranking commander of the powerful Kataib Hezbollah militia who is responsible for \u201cdirectly planning and participating in attacks\u201d on American troops in the region, the U.S. military said Wednesday.\n\nThe precision blast hit a main thoroughfare in the Mashtal neighborhood in eastern Baghdad, attracting a crowd as emergency teams picked through the wreckage. It came amid roiling tensions in the region, and will likely further anger Iraqi government leaders, who U.S. officials said were not notified in advance of the strike.\n\nSecurity forces closed off the heavily guarded Green Zone, where a number of diplomatic compounds are located, and there were concerns about social media postings urging protesters to storm the U.S. embassy.\n\nThere were conflicting reports on the number of those killed, with U.S. officials saying the initial assessment was one, and saying there were no civilians hurt or killed. But two officials with Iran-backed militias in Iraq said that three died, including Wissam Muhammad Sabir Al-Saadi, known as Abu Baqir Al-Saadi, the commander in charge of Kataib Hezbollah\u2019s operations in Syria. Kataeb Hezbollah later announced his death \u201cfollowing the bombing of the American occupation forces\u201d in a statement.\n\nThose officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to journalists.\n\nIn a statement, U.S. Central Command said \u201cthere are no indications of collateral damage or civilian casualties at this time.\u201d It added that the U.S. \u201cwill not hesitate to hold responsible all those who threaten our forces\u2019 safety.\u201d\n\nThe strike \u2014 which came at 9:30 p.m. local time \u2014 is certain to inflame already seething relations between Washington and Baghdad. It comes just days after the U.S. military launched an air assault on dozens of sites in Iraq and Syria used by Iranian-backed militias and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in retaliation for a drone strike that killed three U.S. troops and injured more than 40 others at a base in Jordan in late January.\n\nThe U.S. has blamed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a broad coalition of Iran-backed militias, for the attack in Jordan. President Joe Biden and other top leaders have repeatedly warned that the U.S. would continue to retaliate against those responsible for the Jordan attack. And officials have suggested that key militia leaders would be likely targets.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq has regularly claimed strikes on bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria against the backdrop of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, saying that they are in retaliation for Washington\u2019s support of Israel in its war in Gaza that has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run territory.\n\nThere have been nearly 170 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 18, but the latest drone strike in Jordan \u2014 the only one in that country so far \u2014 was the first to take American troops\u2019 lives. The U.S., in response, has struck back about a half dozen times since Oct. 27, targeting weapons storage sites, command and control centers, training facilities and other locations used by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iranian-backed groups, including Kataib Hezbollah.\n\nWednesday\u2019s U.S. strike in Iraq\u2019s capital drew comparisons to the 2020 drone strike in Baghdad that killed Iran\u2019s Quds Force leader Gen. Qassem Soleimani, in response to attacks on U.S. bases there and an assault on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. That bombing also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. And it enraged Iraqi leaders, triggering demands for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country.\n\nKataib Hezbollah had said in a statement that it was suspending attacks on American troops to avoid \u201cembarrassing the Iraqi government\u201d after the strike in Jordan, but others have vowed to continue fighting.\n\nOn Sunday, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed a drone attack on a base housing U.S. troops in eastern Syria killed six fighters from the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led group allied with the United States.\n\nThe latest surge in the regional conflict came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday rejected terms proposed by Hamas for a hostage-release agreement that would lead to a permanent cease-fire, vowing to continue the war until \u201cabsolute victory.\u201d\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the media office of the Houthi rebels in Yemen reported two airstrikes in Ras Issa area in Salif district in Hodeida province.\n\nMadhani and Baldor reported from Washington. Associated Press journalist Ali Jabar in Baghdad contributed to this report."

We will not hesitate to hold responsible all those who threaten our forces' safety,\" it added.\n\nIraqi authorities slammed the strike as a \"blatant assassination\" in a residential neighbourhood of Baghdad.\n\n\"The international coalition is completely overstepping the reasons and objectives for which it is present on our territory,\" said Yehia Rasool, the military spokesman for Iraq's prime minister.\n\n\"This path pushes the Iraqi government more than ever before to end the coalition's mission which has become a factor of instability for Iraq,\" he added.\n\nHe was referring to the US-led international military alliance formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State group -- the year the jihadist group overran nearly a third of Iraq's territory.\n\nKataeb Hezbollah -- which announced it was suspending its attacks on US forces after the deadly Jordan attack -- said one of its commanders had been killed, identifying him as Abu Baqr al-Saadi. He was responsible for \"military affairs\" in Syria, an official from the group told AFP.\n\nThe Hashed al-Shaabi, a coalition of mainly pro-Iran paramilitaries -- of which Kataeb Hezbollah is part -- now integrated into Iraq's regular security forces, also confirmed Saadi's death.\n\nAn interior ministry official said a total of three people -- two Kataeb Hezbollah leaders and their driver -- had died in the strike, which was carried out by a drone in the east Baghdad neighbourhood of Mashtal.\n\nThe latest US strike sparked widespread condemnation in Iraq, with a pro-Iran parliamentary coalition dubbing it an attack on \"Iraqi sovereignty\".\n\nWashington has \"crossed all red lines by targeting regular forces and men who contributed to defeating Islamic State terrorism,\" said the Coordination Framework, an alliance of pro-Iran Shiite parties that includes the Hashed al-Shaabi.\n\nIraq's pro-Iran Al-Nujaba movement in a statement promised a \"targeted retaliation\", assuring that \"these crimes will not go unpunished\".\n\nThe group added that American \"violations\" will not cease without \"a firm official position from the Iraqi government\".\n\nUS and allied troops have been targeted more than 165 times in the Middle East since mid-October in attacks linked to a surge in violence over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe majority of the attacks have been claimed by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups angered by US support for Israel in the war in Gaza.\n\nLebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group said \"resistance movements in the region have total confidence\" in their Iraqi counterparts and the commander's killing will only encourage them to continue acts they say are in support of Palestinians.\n\nThe United States considers Kataeb Hezbollah a terrorist group.\n\nThe Hashed al-Shaabi has said that 16 of its fighters were killed and 36 people wounded in US strikes on Friday, which Washington said hit 85 targets at seven different sites in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"Targeting the Hashed al-Shaabi is playing with fire,\" the group's leader Faleh al-Fayyad warned later.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said at least 29 pro-Iran fighters were killed in Syria.\n\nIraq analyst Sajad Jiyad, of the New York-based Century Foundation think tank, said he expected the tensions to continue to spiral.\n\n\"These groups have a lot of capabilities, they are active in several countries now, the US is willing to engage, to retaliate, to kill members of these groups,\" he said.\n\n\"The US is giving no indication it is going to pull back or stand down its military activity in the Middle East,\" he said, adding \"it is very difficult to suddenly see an end to the tensions.\"\n\nThe United States and Iraq opened talks on the future of the US-led troop presence in January, following a request by Iraqi Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani for a timetable for their withdrawal.\n\nWashington has some 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 in Iraq as part of an international coalition against the Islamic State group.\n\nIts troops in Iraq are deployed at the invitation of Baghdad, but those in Syria are located in areas outside Syrian government control."

The commander, whose funeral began on Thursday afternoon, was responsible for \"military affairs\" in Syria, an official from the group told AFP.\n\nThe Hashed al-Shaabi, a coalition of mainly pro-Iran paramilitaries -- of which Kataeb Hezbollah is part -- now integrated into Iraq's regular security forces, also confirmed Saadi's death.\n\nAn interior ministry official said a total of three people -- two Kataeb Hezbollah leaders and their driver -- had died in the strike, which was carried out by a drone in the east Baghdad neighbourhood of Mashtal.\n\n\n\n- 'Red lines' -\n\n\n\nThe latest US strike sparked widespread condemnation in Iraq, with a pro-Iran parliamentary coalition dubbing it an attack on \"Iraqi sovereignty\".\n\nWashington has \"crossed all red lines by targeting regular forces and men who contributed to defeating Islamic State terrorism,\" said the Coordination Framework, an alliance of pro-Iran Shiite parties that includes the Hashed al-Shaabi.\n\nIraq's pro-Iran Al-Nujaba movement in a statement promised a \"targeted retaliation\", saying that \"these crimes will not go unpunished\".\n\nThe group added that American \"violations\" will not cease without \"a firm official position from the Iraqi government\".\n\nIran joined in the condemnation on Thursday, with Nasser Kanani, spokesman for the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, calling the strike an act of \"adventurism\" that was \"a threat to regional and international peace and stability\".\n\nUS and allied troops have been targeted more than 165 times in the Middle East since mid-October in attacks linked to a surge in violence over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe majority of the attacks have been claimed by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups angered by US support for Israel in the war in Gaza.\n\nLebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group said \"resistance movements in the region have total confidence\" in their Iraqi counterparts and the commander's killing would only encourage them to continue acts they say are in support of Palestinians.\n\nThe United States considers Kataeb Hezbollah a terrorist group.\n\n\n\n- 'Playing with fire' -\n\n\n\nThe Hashed al-Shaabi has said that 16 of its fighters were killed and 36 people wounded in US strikes on Friday, which Washington said hit 85 targets at seven different sites in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"Targeting the Hashed al-Shaabi is playing with fire,\" the group's leader Faleh al-Fayyad warned later.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said at least 29 pro-Iran fighters were killed in Syria.\n\nIraq analyst Sajad Jiyad, of the New York-based Century Foundation think tank, said he expected the tensions to continue to spiral.\n\n\"These groups have a lot of capabilities, they are active in several countries now, the US is willing to engage, to retaliate, to kill members of these groups,\" he said.\n\n\"The US is giving no indication it is going to pull back or stand down its military activity in the Middle East,\" he said, adding \"it is very difficult to suddenly see an end to the tensions.\"\n\nThe United States and Iraq opened talks on the future of the US-led troop presence in January, following a request by Iraqi Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani for a timetable for their withdrawal.\n\nWashington has some 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 in Iraq as part of an international coalition against the Islamic State group.\n\nIts troops in Iraq are deployed at the invitation of Baghdad, but those in Syria are located in areas outside Syrian government control."

He said the JUI-F candidate was not at the election office when the blast took place. Security had been beefed up in the area.\n\nAddressing a press conference, Achakzai said the local administration had the authority to call the army, if necessary. The minister said terrorists would not succeed in their objectives adding that the war would continue till the elimination of last terrorist.\n\n\u201cThe terrorist state of India has targeted Balochistan through terrorism. We will avenge the martyrs, we will end India\u2019s terrorist agenda. Our war will continue until the end of the last terrorist,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister assured that peaceful elections will be held in Balochistan tomorrow (today). \u201cThe people of Balochistan will come out and destroy the ambitions of terrorists,\u201d Achakzai said.\n\nSpeaking about the injured, the minister said they would be sent to other cities if they could not be treated in Quetta.\n\nAchakzai said the government will continue to perform its responsibilities despite the tragic incident. He said Caretaker Balochistan Chief Minister Ali Mardan Khan Domki had sought a report from the home department on the explosions. \u201cSuch incidents are a conspiracy to sabotage the process of peaceful elections,\u201d he said.\n\nSecretary health Balochistan told Geo News that emergency has been imposed across hospitals in Quetta and additional staff had also been called out.

It came amid roiling tensions in the region, and will likely further anger Iraqi government leaders, who U.S. officials said were not notified in advance of the strike.\n\nSecurity forces closed off the heavily guarded Green Zone, where a number of diplomatic compounds are located, and there were concerns about social media postings urging protesters to storm the U.S. embassy.\n\nThere were conflicting reports on the number of those killed, with U.S. officials saying the initial assessment was one, and saying there were no civilians hurt or killed. But two officials with Iran-backed militias in Iraq said that three died, including Wissam Muhammad Sabir Al-Saadi, known as Abu Baqir Al-Saadi, the commander in charge of Kataib Hezbollah\u2019s operations in Syria. Kataeb Hezbollah later announced his death \u201cfollowing the bombing of the American occupation forces\u201d in a statement.\n\nThose officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to journalists.\n\nIn a statement, U.S. Central Command said \u201cthere are no indications of collateral damage or civilian casualties at this time.\u201d It added that the U.S. \u201cwill not hesitate to hold responsible all those who threaten our forces\u2019 safety.\u201d\n\nThe strike \u2014 which came at 9:30 p.m. local time \u2014 is certain to inflame already seething relations between Washington and Baghdad.

President Joe Biden and other top leaders have repeatedly warned that the U.S. would continue to retaliate against those responsible for the Jordan attack.

The U.S., in response, has struck back about a half dozen times since Oct. 27, targeting weapons storage sites, command and control centers, training facilities and other locations used by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iranian-backed groups, including Kataib Hezbollah.\n\nWednesday\u2019s U.S. strike in Iraq\u2019s capital drew comparisons to the 2020 drone strike in Baghdad that killed Iran\u2019s Quds Force leader Gen. Qassem Soleimani, in response to attacks on U.S. bases there and an assault on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. That bombing also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. And it enraged Iraqi leaders, triggering demands for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country.\n\nKataib Hezbollah had said in a statement that it was suspending attacks on American troops to avoid \u201cembarrassing the Iraqi government\u201d after the strike in Jordan, but others have vowed to continue fighting.\n\nOn Sunday, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed a drone attack on a base housing U.S. troops in eastern Syria killed six fighters from the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led group allied with the United States.\n\nThe latest surge in the regional conflict came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday rejected terms proposed by Hamas for a hostage-release agreement that would lead to a permanent cease-fire, vowing to continue the war until \u201cabsolute victory.\u201d\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the media office of the Houthi rebels in Yemen reported two airstrikes in Ras Issa area in Salif district in Hodeida province.\n\n___\n\nMadhani and Baldor reported from Washington.

    "source": "GDELT",
    "message": "by Austin Bay February 7, 2024\n\nAyatollah Iran treats the world as a war zone.\n\nHere's a list of regional battlegrounds: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Persian Gulf Arab nations, Yemen and Jordan. On Jan. 28, a drone launched by an Iranian proxy militia operating in Iraq struck the U.S.-manned Tower 22 observation outpost in northeastern Jordan. The explosion killed three U.S. Army soldiers and injured at least three dozen more service members.\n\nYemen's Houthis, an Iranian proxy army, wage war on global shipping. Their attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean spike maritime insurance rates. That increases prices for everything, even food. Iran plays the same dirty game with oil prices when it threatens to close the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the oil-producing Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean.\n\nVenezuela's socialist dictatorship aligns with Tehran. For the past six months, Venezuela's Maduro regime has been threatening to attack neighboring Guyana. On Feb. 5, the AP reported the U.S. is \"increasing its urgent military assistance to Guyana.\" In strategic terms, this means we face an Iranian proxy front in the Western Hemisphere. It's also an oil war with potential global economic consequences. Venezuela has around 400 billion barrels of oil; Guyana has a large field -- perfect targets for ayatollah meddling.\n\nSince the 1990s, Iran's Khomeinist regime has waged a global Aryan nationalist holy war.\n\nIran is Aryanistan. Land of the Aryans. Check it out. The Iran Aryans despise Semites; Arabs and Jews are Semites. Ishmael, Arab progenitor, was a son of Abraham. That's one deep reason Donald Trump's Abraham Accords had traction.\n\nKhomeinist refers to followers of Khomeinism, the violent ideology of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini who toppled the Shah in 1979. Khomeini was a bitter old man who liked to write love-laced pleasure-enthused Persian poetry when he wasn't despising Western civilization.\n\nFailed artist turning to revolution -- that's a deadly history. Karl Marx was a failed German poet. Marx wanted to be Novalis (a brilliant German Romantic poet and polymath -- check him out). Adolf Hitler (a self-proclaimed Aryan Fuhrer) was a failed painter. I'm told Khomeini's poems are ersatz Omar Khayyam but at times show signs of merit.\n\nBlunt poetry: Khomeini dubbed America the Great Satan.\n\nKhomeinists wage slow war on America and its allies. In 1984, the State Department put Iran on its list of state sponsors of terrorism. It's still on it. Iran uses human trafficking to facilitate and fund destabilizing activities. Regime intelligence and special operations agencies are involved in drug trafficking.\n\nIn 2011, an Iranian operative was arrested before he could assassinate a Saudi diplomat in Washington, D.C. The Iranian operative intended to kill the diplomat with a bomb. An America with open borders is an easy target.\n\nAlas, Iran's corrupt and cynical fanatics rule an educated nation-state that has the petrodollars to turn nuclear knowledge into weapons. And they are doing so. Israel's Stuxnet malware did more to delay Iran's nuclear program than the Obama administration's delusional Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The JCPOA put money in the ayatollahs' coffers.\n\nIranian leaders still refer to Israel as a \"one bomb state.\" That refers to one large nuclear weapon striking Tel Aviv.\n\nSo far, the U.S. has responded to the deadly Jan. 28 Tower 22 attack by striking back at Iranian proxies -- at Iraqi, Syrian and Houthi proxies.\n\nI've no doubt that the air and missile strikes have had tactical success -- destroyed launch facilities and munitions dumps, killed a few proxy fighters.\n\nThese tactical strikes, however, ignore the strategic problem -- an inimical regime that is no longer deterred by U.S. might.\n\nAt some point, the Iranian regime itself must suffer a heavy and deadly military blow.\n\nOne option: a \"simultaneous strategic bombing strike\" (SSBS, first described by StrategyPage.com in 2003). In a short time frame, aircraft, cruise missiles, drones and perhaps ballistic missiles with conventional warheads deliver hundreds of precision weapons, hitting regime nuclear targets, Iranian Al-Quds special forces and Revolutionary Guard command and control facilities, air defense sites, ballistic missile sites and intelligence agency facilities.\n\nU.S. forces can do this if the president gives the order.\n\nIn August 2010, NBC's \"Meet the Press\" panel asked Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen if the Pentagon had a plan for attacking Iran. Mullen replied, \"We do.\" He added, \"Military actions have been on the table and remain on the table.\"\n\nIt's time for action."

They decided to read identical news sources about the war to help make sure they stayed on the same page.\n\n\u201cWe needed to really hear each other and share our perspectives, and make sure we were creating an environment that didn\u2019t lead to conflict between the two of us,\u201d Ms. Friedmann said.\n\nMany American Jews have reconsidered how they feel about Israel and even their own Jewish identity since the Oct. 7 attack, in which Israeli officials say Hamas militants killed roughly 1,200 people. Israel\u2019s reprisal, a bombing campaign and invasion, has killed more than 26,000 people, Palestinian officials say."

    "message": "An American military airstrike on Wednesday killed a top commander of an Iran-backed militia umbrella group that the Biden administration says was responsible for recent attacks on U.S. troops, in the latest retaliatory operation against those behind the drone strike that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan late last month.\n\nIn a statement, the Pentagon\u2019s Central Command did not identify the individual in question but said he was a commander of the group Kata\u2018ib Hezbollah, and had a hand in at least some of the recent missile and drone assaults on American bases in the region.\n\nU.S. forces \u201cconducted a unilateral strike in Iraq in response to the attacks on U.S. service members, killing a Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah commander responsible for directly planning and participating in attacks on U.S. forces in the region,\u201d CENTCOM said.\n\n\u201cThere are no indications of collateral damage or civilian casualties at this time,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe United States will continue to take necessary action to protect our people. We will not hesitate to hold responsible all those who threaten our forces\u2019 safety.\u201d\n\nOfficials told the Associated Press that a U.S. drone struck a car traveling through Baghdad on Wednesday night, killing three members of Kata\u2018ib Hezbollah, including the commander. The strike came on a main thoroughfare in the Mashtal neighborhood in eastern Baghdad, the AP reported.\n\nOfficials with Iran-backed militias in Iraq identified one of the dead as Wissam Mohammed \u201cAbu Bakr\u201d al-Saadi, the commander of Kata\u2018ib Hezbollah\u2019s operations in Syria, according to media reports.\n\nWednesday\u2019s strike makes good on the Biden administration\u2018s promise that it would continue hitting back against Kata\u2018ib Hezbollah and other Iraqi Shiite militias that have direct links to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Last Friday, U.S. fighter jets and drones hit dozens of targets, including command and control headquarters, ammunition storage, intelligence centers, and other facilities used by the Quds Force, a wing of the IRGC, and the militias affiliated with it.\n\nCENTCOM said the Friday missions struck more than 85 targets in a well-coordinated operation. More than 125 precision munitions were used, Pentagon officials said, with some long-range bombers flown from the U.S. to the Middle East to take part in the long-awaited American counterattack.\n\nThose strikes came less than a week after a drone attack killed three American service members at a military base in Jordan. The Pentagon blamed that attack on the network of Iran-backed militias operating across the region.\n\nOver the past few months, those groups have launched more than 150 attacks against U.S. troops in the Middle East. Those attacks have grown more frequent and more deadly since Oct. 7, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas \u2014 also financially and logistically backed by Iran \u2014 launched its own massive terrorist attack on Israel.\n\nSuccessive U.S. administrations have now proven themselves willing to strike targets in Iraq\u2019s capital when necessary. In January 2020, then-President Donald Trump ordered a strike on Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s IRGC, whom the administration painted as the key conduit between Tehran and the Shiite militias attacking U.S. troops. He was killed at Baghdad\u2019s international airport.\n\nWednesday\u2019s attack surely will spark more discord between the U.S. and the Iraqi government, which condemned last week\u2019s strikes against Iran-backed militias on its soil and has begun talks about the possible removal of more than 2,000 American troops based in the country.\n\n\u2022 Ben Wolfgang can be reached at bwolfgang@washingtontimes.com."
