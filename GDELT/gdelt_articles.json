The top legislature passed the country's first anti-terrorism law on Sunday, together with several other laws. ZHANG JIA/XINHUA News that Turkey has arrested two Chinese nationals of Uygur origin in connection with a mass shooting in a nightclub in Istanbul on New Year's Eve underscores the necessity and urgency for Beijing and Ankara to work more closely together to combat cross-border terrorism. Identified as members of an unspecified \"terrorist organization\", the two have been charged with \"purchasing unlicensed firearms\" and \"being accomplices\" to the murder of 39 people in the attack for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. It would be no surprise if the two Uygurs proved to have links with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. The UN-listed terrorist group, dedicated to the separation of Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region from China, has long been responsible for a series of deadly terrorist attacks in and outside China. Last August, a suicide bombing of the Chinese embassy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, which killed one person and injured three, was ordered by \"Uygur terrorist groups active in Syria\" and carried out by a member of ETIM in that country, according to Kyrgyzstan's national security authorities. There are no official statistics on the number of Chinese Uygurs currently living in Turkey, whose stay there has been cited mainly as a result of linguistic and cultural similarities. Not all of them have crossed the border legally, sometimes even aided by smuggling rings related to terrorist activities. Terrorism is the common enemy of mankind, and to win the battle against it requires enhanced international cooperation, and in this case between China and Turkey, in such areas as intelligence sharing, evidence collecting, border controls and cutting the terrorists' access to funding sources. That is partly why China, together with other countries, initiated the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as a regional mechanism to target terrorism, separatism and extremism. Sino-Turkish ties, despite being smooth in recent years, have been marred occasionally by anti-China protests staged in Turkey against what some falsely perceive as the \"plight of Uygurs\". In addition, bias, ignorance and lies have combined to continue to lead some people, especially those in the West, to adopt a double standard when addressing terrorism. The United States, for example, has yet to add ETIM to the Department of State's main list of foreign terrorist organizations. The latest arrests in Turkey may serve as a wake-up call that terrorism is terrorism whatever guise it comes in.

Surveillance footage showed the powerful blast exploding in front of the nation's Labor ministry, shattering its steel-and-glass fa\u00c3\u00a7ade and gutting offices as far up as the sixth floor. Surrounding buildings were also scarred, and metal at a nearby construction site was mangled and melted. There were no casualties in Saturday's blast, but authorities said the fallout could have been bloody if the explosion had hit the Greek capital's busiest boulevard, an area teeming with bars, coffee shops and restaurants, during business hours. It was the first terrorist attack to mar the streets of Athens in five years, and Public Order Minister Michalis Chrysochoides said authorities are seriously concerned about the resurgence of terrorism. Greece has seen hits like this in the past, and he said authorities will do everything to safeguard democracy and the country's image. The attack was claimed by a new urban guerilla group calling itself the Revolutionary Class Self-Defense. Security experts suspect the new group includes militant recruits drafted by terrorists remaining at large after the country's most deadly terror group was disbanded some 20 years ago. Since then, several smaller groupings have emerged, staging sporadic low-grade attacks, but none of this intensity. At least 5 kilograms of explosives were used. Stavros Balaskas, a police investigator, said counterterrorism officials were focusing on forensic evidence to track the culprit from a list of potential suspects. Surveillance footage Balaskas says, shows a man making his way across the road to the ministry, hanging a sack of explosives on a steel railing and leaving. Members of the group claimed responsibility in telephone calls to a local newspaper and television station 40 minutes ahead of the explosion. Authorities expect the group will issue a proclamation to explain who they are and the reasons they targeted the Labor Ministry. Until then, investigators warn, the fear of a follow-up hit, potentially with victims, looms.

February 25, 1988 12 min read Download Report Daryl Plunk Former Senior Visiting Fellow Daryl is a former Senior Visiting Fellow Copied Select a Section 1 /0 Toggle open close (Archived document, may contain errors) No. 74 February 25, 1988 NORTH KOREA: EXPORTING TERRORISM INTRODUCTION After extensive investigation, the government of the Republic of Korea has concluded that communist North Korean agents had planted the bomb that exploded aboard a Korean Airlines plane last November, killing all 115 passengers and crew. This act of terrorism appears to have been an attempt by North Korea to destabilize the Republic of Korea - ROK or South Korea - and to disrupt this summer's Seoul Olympic Games. Responding to a joint request from the South Korean and Japanese missions to the United Nations, the U.N. Security Council convened in special session last week to consider South Korea's charges. Twelve of the 15 Council members condemned the North Korean action, with only the Soviet Union, China, and Zambia refusing to admit Pyongyang's responsibility for the bombing. Calling the incident \"a grave challenge to international peace and security,\" Japan's U.N. ambassador demanded that North Korea \"refrain from repeating such criminal acts.\" South Korean Foreign Minister Kw9ng-soo Choi insisted that Pyongyang \"renounce terrorism once and for all as an instrument of state policy.\" High Stake Competition. The terrorist attack by North Korea against South Korea and last week's confrontation before the U.N. Security Council typifies the tension on the Korean Peninsula. Since the division of the peninsula in 1948, the rival governments in Seoul and Pyongyang have been involved in a high stakes competition to eclipse one another and emerge as the legitimate government of the entire peninsula. Throughout these years of struggle, the North consistently has shown its willingness to use violence and military force. In June 1950, North Korea invaded the South, launching a three-year war which cost an estimated one million Korean and over 50,000 American lives. More recently, North Korea has sought to strengthen its diplomatic hand through aggressive support for international revolutionary movements. Using special training camps in North Korea as well as its own military personnel stationed abroad, Pyongyang has offered its terrorist skills to developing nation allies around the world. It has trained more than 5,000 terrorist recruits from 25 countries. North Korean military \"advisors,\" meantime, have operated in some 30 nations; to Angola alone, Pyongyang has sent 1,000 advisors and 3,000 regular troops, while another 250 advisors are at work in Libya and 300 in Nicaragua. And North Korea's terrorist allies have included Italy's Red Brigades, West Germany's Baader-Meinhof Gang, the Japanese Red Army and, predictably, the Palestine liberation Organization. Attempting Murder. Sponsorship of terrorist attacks against the ROK has been part of Pyongyang's campaign to destabilize the South.The recent airliner bombing was not the first time that the North Koreans have used terrorist violence against their rival to the south. Twice in the last twenty years, agents from Pyongyang have tried to murder ROK presidents. While America has no diplomatic relations with the regime led by aging North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung, the U.S. government should use all means available to encourage economic and diplomatic sanctions to press North Korea to cease its state sponsorship of violence. Also, the U.S. should urge its allies and Eastern-bIoc nations alike to take similar measures. Finally, Washington should urge the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to act against North Korea's terrorism. PYONGYANG'S MAJOR EXPORTS: ARMS AND REVOLUTION Article 16 of North Korea's constitution calls for - unity with all the people of the world opposed to imperialism\" and support for the \"struggles for national liberation and revolution.\" In the early 1970s, Pyongyang began to put this principle into practice. The result: the North is training and arming terrorists and revolutionaries in Africa, Latin America, Middle East, and Asia. The North has sought to bolster its international standing by forging new alliances. With its economy in shambles, however, economic ties with North Korea offer little rewards. Hence, Pyongyang has sought to use the export of revolution and terror as an instrument of its foreign policy and a source of revenues. These efforts also work to the advantage of the North's main communist ally, the Soviet Union, and Moscow's desire to recruit communist proxies around the world. Over the last twiDnty years, North Korea has built some 30 special training camps within its borders which specialize in terrorist and guerilla warfare training. Intelligence sources report that over 5,000 recruits from some 25 nations have visited these camps to take part in various courses @lasting from 3 to'18 months. Pyongyang also exports terrorist skflls. Over the past two decades, the North Koreans have dispatched some 8,000 military personnel to train thousands of soldiers in more than 30 countries. I According to Jane's Defence Weekly, \"North Korean -training is the cheapest available.\"2 Africa Pyongyang's principal target has been Africa, where, as two experts on Korea recently observed, \"North Korea should be seen as the new relay in the execution of the African strategy of the USSR.\", 3 Pyongyang now is assisting the Soviets in their campaign to recruit clients on the African continent. Angola is the largest North Korean base of operation in Africa. The Marxist regime in Luanda faces a formidable challenge from the freedom fighters of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Indeed, only the presence of over 40,000 Cuban combat troops backed by several thousand Soviet and East German military advisors has prevented a UNITA victory. In 1984, North Korea provided further backing to Luanda by sending 3,000 regular troops and 1,000 advisors. 4 Angola also is the site of North Korean training camps for guerrillas of the African National Congress (ANC) and the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO). Operating from bases in Southern Angola, SWAP0 uses terrorist tactics to destabilize Namibia, and the ANC uses terrorism to bring down the South African government in Pretoria. Zimbabwe has been Pyongyang's largest arms customer in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since taking power in 1980, the government of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe has received over $400 million in North Korean equipment, including tanks, armored personnel carriers and artiflery. Mugabe also has requested North Korean miHtary assistance for his fledgling army. In 1980, Pyongyang responded by sending 150 trainers to Zimbabwe. North Korean military advisors organized and trained the now notorious Zimbabwe 5th Brigade, which massacred 2,000 civilians in Metabeleland during a 1983 campaign,against Mugabe's erstwhile political rival Joshua Nkomo. 1 Vantage Point, Naewoe Press, Seoul, South Korea, March 1986, p. 11. 2 Jane's Defence Weekly, April 4,1987, p. 587. 3 P. Chaigneau and R. Sola, \"North Korea as an African Power\", Institute for Strategic Studies, University of Pretoria, South Africa, December 1986, p. 11. 4 Vantage Poin4 p. 13. The North Koreans are making inroads elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa. Uganda has purchased $40 million to $50 million in North Korean rifles, ammunition, tanks, and military training since 1980. In the Seychelles, 80 North Ko 2 an soldiers \"have de facto been controlling the [country's] defense force of 1,000 men.\" About 150 troops dispatched by Pyongyang serve in the Ethiopian Presidential Guard of Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam and, in late 1984, North Korea pledged to help construct a small arms factory in Ethiopia. Last year, Zambia concluded an agreement allowing for its armed forces to receive three years of North Korean military training. Not surprisingly, Pyongyang has maintained close ties with fellow terrorist nation Libya. Since the mid-1980s, military advisors from Pyongyang have worked with Libya to assist the rebels in northern Chad. Tripoli has been an important NorthKorean arms client, having purchased $430 million in tanks and anti-aircraft guns since; 1978. About 250' military advisors from Pyongyang serve in Libya, some of whom are flight trainers at the Libyan Air Force Academy. Middle East Pyongyang has dispatched military trainers to South Yemen, Iran, and Syria and has sold BM- 11 multiple rocket launchers to Cairo, Damascus, and Tehran.\\u223\\'a7 By far the largest recipient of North Korean arms and training in the Middle East has been Iran; Since the Iran-Iraq war began in September 1980, North Korea has sold an estimated $1 billion in weapons to Iran, including fighter jets and tanks. Pyongyang also has served as a Chinese proxy by reselling arms to Tehran which originally were supplied by Beijing. These Chinese weapons shipments to Iran via North Korea are known to have included Silkworm missiles. About 300 North Korean military advisors currently are stationed in 7 Iran, many of whom are involved in pilot training. Latin America North Korean adventurism in the Western Hemisphere received,world attention in October 1983 when the U.S. forces liberating Grenada discovered 24 North Korean 5 Chaigneau and Sola, op. cit., p. 7. 6 Jane's Defence Weekly, November 7, 1987, p. 1059. 7 Insight Magazine, July 20, 1987, p. 31. advisors on the island. Also discovered was a secret document detailing a \"free offer\" of $12 million in military assistance from Pyongyang to the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada \"for the purposes of further cementing and developing the friendship and solidarity between our peoples and armies.'18 North Korean strongman Kim Il Sung's closest ally in the Western Hemisphere is Fidel Castro, who visited Pyongyang in March 1986 and signed a twenty-year defense treaty with North Korea. The two leaders pledged their support for \"the non-aligned movement and national liberation movements ... in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the rest of the world.\" Castro thanked Kim 11 Sung for selling the Cubans \"100,000 automatic rifles and tens of millions of rounds of ammunition.\"9 Since Castro already receives some $4 billion in annual economic assistance from the Soviet Union, it is strongly suspected that these weapons from Pyongyang are being funneled to Nicaragua. It is estimated, meanwhile, that 300 North Koreans advisors have been sent to Managua to train Sandinista troops. PYONGYANG'S TERRORIST TIES Over the years, North Korea has been linked to numerous international terrorist and revolutionary networks, including Italy's Red Brigades, West Germany's Baader-Meinhof Gang, and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Some analysts see Pyongyang's hand in the resurgence of the Japanese Red Army. A European intelligence report recently claimed that the Japanese Red Army, whil@ relatively inactive for over a decade, has resumed action in international terrorism.' 10 The report also claims that some Red Army terrorists have been trained at camps in North Korea and, in turn, have trained Philippine communist insurgents at a base in Lebanon. And according to other intelligence reports, the Red Army is suspected of masterminding the rocket attacks on U.S. Embassies in Jakarta and Madrid in 1986 and in Rome last year. TERRORISM A7GAINST THE ROK Kim Il Sung's regime has been implicated directly in several attempts to assassinate South Korean presidents. In 1968, some 31 North Korean commandos infiltrated the South- and assaulted the Blue House, the presidential compound near central Seoul. The ensuing 8 Grenada D\"uments, U.S. State and Defense Departments, Washington, D.C., September 1984, document #20. 9 Foreign Broadcast Infonnation Serw4ce Daily Report (Asia), March 12, 1986, p. D 10. 10 7he Washington 7-unes, January 13,1988, p. 8. battle ended only after all but one of the commandos had been killed by South Korean defenders. In October 1983, the North attempted to murder ROK President Chun Doo Hwan during his state visit to Rangoon, Burma. A powerful bomb exploded during a wreath laying ceremony at a national shrine for Burmese war victims, killing four Burmese officials and 17 South Koreans. Four of the dead were ROK cabinet ministers. After two North Korean army officers were found guilty of the bombing by a Rangoon court, Burma severed diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. KAL FLIGHT 858 Last November 29, Korean Airlines (KAL) flight 858 en route from Baghdad to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi vanished with 115 passengers aboard. The speed with which the airliner disappeared from radar screens immediately suggested foul play. Because the disappearance occurred after a scheduled stop in Abu Dhabi, South Korean authorities focused attention on the 15 passengers who deplaned there. Two of them, identified as a father and daughter traveling under Japanese passports, already had flown on to Bahrain. When the two attempted to board another flight in Bahrain, Japanese officials on the scene examined their passports and found them to be forgeries. While awaiting further questioning in an airport office, the couple attempted suicide by swallowing poisoned capsules concealed in cigarette filters. The elderly man died but the young woman survived and was extradited to Seoul. On January 15, the ROK announced the result of its investigation. Ile two agents were identified as Mr. Kim Sung Il, 70, and Miss Kim Hyan Hee, 26, both North Korean citizens. The woman's confession produced a startling and sober series of revelations about her own involvement in this terrorist act and Pyongyang's involvement in terrorism directed at the ROK. Her testimony revealed: * That she and her accomplice had planted explosives on the KAL jet under orders from Kim Jong Il, the son and heir apparent of North Korean strongman Kim 11 Sung. # That her father was a North Korean Foreign Ministry Official who currently is the fisheries attache at Pyongyang's embassy in Angola. + That both she and her deceased partner, with whom she had worked as a \"father-daughter\" team since 1984, worked for the Research Department of the North Korea Communist Party's Central Committee, and she had been schooled as a covert operations officer for seven years. + That, after receiving a month of explosives training, the pair departed North Korea for Baghdad via Moscow, Budapest, Vienna, and Belgrade. Kim Jong Il reportedly hoped that the disappearance of the South Korean airliner would accomplish two political goals. First, the incident would raise worldwide suspicions about the ability of the South Koreans to provide security during this summer's Seoul Olympic Games; second, coming just two weeks before the first open ROK Oresidential election in sixteen years, the plane's downing might cause a domestic crisis and derail the ongoing democratization process. NORTH-SOUTH COMPETITION Despite North Korea's almost constant efforts to destabilize; the ROK, Pyongyang is losing the competition with the ROK Seoul is outstripping its rival. in economic performance and international recognition and has grown increasingly confident in its standoff with the North. 77te Wall Street Journal recently reported that \"Seoul has replaced Pyongyang-bashing with a world-wide diplomatic offensive to achieve dominance over the North.\"11 The diplomatic scorecard is revealing: Seoul leads Pyongyang by 128 to 102 in official relations with foreign governments. On the economic front, the South's well known successes are wooing even staunch North Korean allies such as the'People's Republic of China (PRC) into unofficial trade ties. Last year, ROK-PRC trade is reported to have reached $1.5 billion. South Korean exports to the Tbird World consist-of genuine economic assistance rather than arms and terrorist training. By 1992, the ROIcs new Overseas Cooperation Fund, similar to the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), will offer loans to Korean companies seeking to invest in developing markets. 12 Giving Up the Goal. Later this year, Seoul will host the 1988 Olympic Games, an important milestone for the ROK For three weeks in September Seoulf will be at the center of the world's attention. Despite its acts of violence and attempts to organize. a boycott, North Korea has failed derail the Games. On the contrary, because the Soviet Union', China, and other major Eastern bloc nations have officially accepted the Olympic invitations, this year's Games will be the first to be free from a political boycott in twelve years. Only North Korea, Cuba, Libya, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, Albania, and the Seychelles have turned down the invitations. Ile South Koreans hope that the boost they receive from the Olympics will propel them-- into a pre-eminent position on the Korean peninsula, force the North to give up its goal of eventually conquering the South, and compel Pyongyang to bargain-on Seoul's terms. 11 Fredrick Kempe, \"Olympics is Giving South Korea an Edge in Battle to Woo North Korea's Friends\", 7he Wall Street Jouma4 January 13, 1988, p. 16. 12 Ibid. CONCLUSION For the past several years, foreign observers have suggestedithat a generational change is underway in Pyongyang and that a new era of North Korean moderation and pragmatism, similar to the reform movement in mainland China, is at hand. 13 Sensing the political and public relations value inherent in such an image, the North Korean; leadership has sought to promote this perception. In truth, the North seems to be growing more desperate and aggressive in the face of Seoul's successes. The Reagan Administration has begun to recognize the danger posed by North Korean terrorism. In the wake of the KAL bombing the State Department declared that Pyongyang's actions 'just don't live up to the standards of civilized behavior\" and announced on January 20 that North Korea had been placed on the official U-.S. list of nations which engage in international terrorism. The other countries on that list are Iran, Libya, Syria, and South Yemen. The State Department also tightened travel restrictions on North Korean visitors to the U.S. and revoked last year's relaxation of \"contact policy,\" which for the first time allowed American diplomats to engage in unofficial and informal conversations with North Korean counterparts. The U.S. should take other steps aimed to punish Pyongyang for its involvement in state-sponsored terrorism. Among them: * Washington should support Seoul's plan to raise the bombing incident during the upcoming meeting in Montreal of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). At the February 29 ICAO Executive Council session, South Korea will introduce a resolution condemning North Korea for the grave threat it poses to international aviation. * The U.S. should encourage its allies to condemn the North's terrorist actions and apply appropriate diplomatic and economic sanctions against Pyongyang. + Washington should press North Korea's communist allies, particularly China and the Soviet Union, to condemn the North's brutality and use their private channels to warn the Kim 11 Sung regime against using such tactics in the future. 13 For an example of this analysis, see Selig Harrison, \"North Korea Floats a Revolutionary Idea: Realism,\" Ae New York 271mes, November 22,1987, p. E3. # Ile U.S. should offer the ROK appropriate assistance to guarantee security during the Seoul Olympic Games. I Daryl M.

The United Nations has said it will investigate its agency for Palestinian refugees to ensure \u201cneutrality.\u201d This followed the allegations by Israel that no fewer than 12 UN staffers assisted in the Hamas-led terrorist attack of October 7. UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, who announced the move in a statement on Monday, said he had established an \u201cindependent review group\u201d to probe \u201callegations of serious breaches\u201d at the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). According to him, the probe would seek to \u201cidentify the mechanisms and procedures that the Agency currently has in place to ensure neutrality and to respond to allegations or information indicating that the principle may have been breached.\u201d Though Guterres stopped short of outlining the alleged breaches, Israeli officials have repeatedly accused 12 UNRWA workers of involvement in last year\u2019s Hamas cross-border raid, which killed around 1,200 people in Israel and saw more than 200 taken hostage by Palestinian militants. Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, later hailed the decision, saying \u201cWe will submit all evidence highlighting UNRWA's ties to terrorism and its harmful effects on regional stability.\u201d Guterres previously acknowledged that nine of the 12 UN staffers allegedly linked to Hamas had been fired, while two remained unidentified and another had since been killed. Though the Israeli allegations have yet to be independently confirmed, more than a dozen countries have already opted to sever funding to the refugee agency, including the United States, Sweden, Britain, and Germany. Last week, a spokesman for the US State Department said that $300,000 set aside for UNRWA would be withheld pending the results of the investigation. Around $121 million had already been distributed to the agency since October 1, as Washington typically devotes up to $400 million to the office each year. While the review panel will focus on UNRWA\u2019s \u201cneutrality,\u201d Guterres noted that a separate investigation into Israel\u2019s charges would continue under the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services. He also went on to stress the agency\u2019s critical role in Gaza, saying that more than 2 million people \u201cdepend on it for their survival amidst one of the largest and most complex humanitarian crises in the world.\u201d Israel\u2019s military response to the October 7 attack has claimed more than 27,000 lives in Gaza, according to local Hamas-run health officials. The UN has warned of a looming calamity in the Palestinian enclave, where hundreds of thousands have been displaced and face extreme shortages of food, medicine, and other essentials. In a statement on Monday, UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths warned that Israel\u2019s \u201cindiscriminate bombing of densely populated areas\u201d could \u201camount to war crimes,\u201d and pointed to a \u201cpublic \u2013 and mental \u2013 health disaster\u201d in the making in Gaza.

Roger Wicker of Mississippi said in a statement given to the Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cIt is past time for our commander-in-chief to adopt a new approach that targets the actual sponsors of terrorism in the region.\u201d Other Republicans and former Trump administration officials made similar statements in media appearances. \u201cThese are late. They should have been done more decisively as President Trump did,\u201d Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney of New York told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. \u201cBut, you know, it\u2019s the policy that President Biden has taken towards Iran to try to get back into the failed nuclear agreement, also to allow sanctions to be lifted on the Iranians so they can sell up to 80-$90 billion worth of oil mostly to China, by the way.\u201d Advertisement - story continues below WATCH: \u201cUnfortunately, we put ourselves in such a bad position against Iran that we need to come back with much more aggressive force,\u201d Tenney added. Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, who appeared with Tenney, called for a resumption of economic sanctions against Iran. \u201cYou have to cut the Iranians off economically,\u201d Donalds told Kudlow. \u201cDonald Trump had them cut off economically. He had them really having to scrap things together for that economy, and they couldn\u2019t put money into these proxy fighters throughout the Middle East.\u201d Advertisement - story continues below \u201cWe must continue to ramp up the pressure on Iran and its terror groups across the Middle East,\u201d Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said in a statement . \u201cHowever, these efforts must include additional sanctions on Iranian oil, which is what allows Iran to fund its campaign of violence and terror across the region.\u201d Retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, who served as an advisor to former Vice President Mike Pence during the Trump administration, questioned if the strikes would deter future attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be sufficient and I think I would caution everybody, this isn\u2019t a time when you rip your shirt off and beat your chest that this is really cool because it shouldn\u2019t be numbers, it should be what happens is the consequences from your attack,\u201d Kellogg told Kudlow. \u201cAnd look, what we\u2019ve given the Iranians is a sanctuary. I\u2019ve been through a sanctuary war before back in the years of Vietnam when Cambodia was a sanctuary, North Vietnam was a sanctuary. You allow a sanctuary, he\u2019ll retreat, move back in there and respond later on.\u201d WATCH: Advertisement - story continues below Kellogg criticized Biden for the delay in the strikes. \u201cThose packages were there, it just took presidential authority, and that\u2019s who does it, to say go,\u201d Kellogg said. \u201cAnd he waited way too long. In fact, those aircraft, from what I understand, the B-1 bombers that took off came out of the United States, they lifted off this morning. They could have lifted off two days ago, three days ago.\u201d Iranian-backed militias have carried out over 150 attacks since Hamas launched a deadly terrorist attack on multiple locations in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing over 1,200 people and taking over 200 hostages, Reuters reported , including the use of ballistic missiles and drones. \u201cFinally,\u201d Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa posted . \u201cIran needs to know the price for American lives.\u201d Advertisement - story continues below One Republican questioned if Biden had authorization to launch the strikes. Once again, this President has circumvented Congress and put our troops in danger. One soldier\u2019s life lost is one too many, let alone three. Our troops need to come home. Our president needs to follow the constitution. \u2014 Rep. Nancy Mace (@RepNancyMace) February 2, 2024 \u201cOnce again, this President has circumvented Congress and put our troops in danger,\u201d Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina posted on X. \u201cOne soldier\u2019s life lost is one too many, let alone three. Our troops need to come home.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese with US President Joe Biden at Point Loma naval base, March 13, 2023, San Diego. [AP Photo/Evan Vucci] In the latest development, on Sunday morning Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared his government\u2019s full support for Washington\u2019s bombings of alleged Iranian-linked sites in Syria and Iraq. Albanese made it clear that this was on top of Labor\u2019s direct military participation in the intensifying US-UK strikes on Yemen, in retaliation for the Houthis\u2019 disruption of Israel\u2019s supply lines. The Houthis have stated they will continue to try to disrupt shipping in the Red Sea until the genocide ceases. Speaking on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s \u201cInsiders\u201d television program, Albanese declared: \u201cWe support the actions of the United States. These are proportionate. These are retaliatory for the actions of Iran-backed organisations. And they are not an escalation. So, we think that the United States has got it right. It\u2019s important that, given the attacks that have occurred by groups backed by Iran, there be a response. There has been.\u201d This was within a day of the US government sending nuclear-capable B-1B bombers to drop over 125 munitions on 85 targets in seven locations throughout Iraq and Syria, followed by Pentagon declarations that this was just the beginning. Many more such attacks will be conducted, clearly escalating the US offensive against Iran and Iranian-backed forces throughout the region. Albanese echoed, virtually word-for-word, the White House\u2019s line. In announcing the attacks last Friday, Biden claimed: \u201cThe United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world.\u201d That obviously flies in the face of the record. The US has kept pouring funding, weapons and logistical support to Israel to carry out the annihilation of Gaza, while flooding the region with warships, aircraft and soldiers, deliberately seeking to provoke a wider war. Ever more clearly, the Israeli genocide in Gaza, which has already killed over 30,000 people, destroyed more than half the tiny enclave\u2019s essential infrastructure and displaced 1.9 million people, is part of a broader US war agenda. American imperialism has been bombing, starving and invading countries throughout the region for decades, including the criminal 2003 invasion of Iraq that led to the deaths of over a million people. Washington is seeking unchallenged hegemony over the Middle East as part of its war drive against Russia and China. An appeal from David North: Donate to the WSWS today Watch the video message from WSWS International Editorial Board Chairman David North. Donate today Moreover, these latest strikes are patently illegal, taking place in defiance of the governments of Syria and Iraq, and being carried out without US congressional authorisation, let alone any approval by the American population. Likewise, Albanese flatly rejected the objections of the Iraqi and Syrian governments that the strikes violate their sovereignty, backing the unlawful US aggression without any public support or even parliamentary vote. The population is being kept in the dark as much as possible. The complicit corporate media has assisted this by burying nearly all mention of Albanese\u2019s interview on \u201cInsiders.\u201d Nor have any questions been asked in the media about Australia\u2019s active involvement in the bombings, in addition to the military personnel that the Labor government has dispatched to join the US-led forces attacking Yemen. It is likely that the ongoing US strikes depend on satellite targeting information from the US-Australian facility at Pine Gap in central Australia, which covers the Middle East as well as the Indo-Pacific. Albanese\u2019s interview further underscored the connection between the US offensive in the Middle East and its preparations for war against China, in which Australia is heavily involved. The prime minister refused to rule out committing more Australian forces to participate in the US attacks. He said his government had not been asked for any further support, because \u201cour concentration is on the Indo-Pacific,\u201d adding: \u201cThat\u2019s something that the United States and our allies certainly understand.\u201d Albanese\u2019s declaration followed an even-less publicised February 1 phone call between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, just a day before the US strikes in Iraq and Syria began. There is no mention of the conversation on Wong\u2019s official website, nor that of her department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. A perfunctory US State Department February 1 \u201creadout,\u201d said the pair had discussed \u201cholding the Houthis accountable\u201d for their attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. Almost certainly, Blinken would have told Wong about the impending strikes in Iraq and Syria, securing the Albanese government\u2019s prior acquiescence. The State Department said the phone call also discussed \u201cthe importance of humanitarian aid reaching those in need in Gaza.\u201d That amounts to a cynical bid to counter the international outrage over the US decision, followed by Australia and other US allies, to suspend funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), the agency responsible for most of the extremely limited aid being permitted into Gaza. In his interview, Albanese defended cutting off the funding. He insisted that Israel\u2019s allegations that 12 UNWRA staff were involved in the October 7 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel \u201cneed to be fully examined to ensure that every single dollar of aid is going to just that, aid.\u201d In reality, the funding cutoff by the US and other imperialist powers underscores their collusion with the Israeli regime in bombing and starving the Palestinians out of Gaza. This is part of a broader campaign of ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians, including in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Mass death by starvation and disease, as well as military slaughter, is the clear intent of Israel and all its backers, no matter what deceptive statements representatives like Blinken and Wong may occasionally make. As well as widespread famine, there is no clean water. Illnesses such as cholera and diarrhea are rife, with no functioning hospitals left to care for the sick. On Friday evening, in another near-secret move, the Albanese government said Australians who were harmed or lost a close family member in the Hamas-led outbreak from the besieged Gaza enclave on October 7 would receive payments of up to $75,000 each. That was because the government had officially declared the event a terrorist act. There is no record of any such payments being offered to the thousands of Australian families whose loved ones have been killed, maimed or displaced by the Zionist terrorism. That underlines the Labor government\u2019s support for the Israeli barbarism. Taken together, the intensifying genocide in Palestine and the US bombing operations demonstrate the political dead-end of trying to put pressure on the imperialist governments, including Albanese\u2019s, to change course, or relying on the International Court of Justice or the United Nations to end to the bloodbath in the Middle East. As the WSWS has explained, stopping the imperialist violence requires the mobilisation of workers and young people around the world against all the governments responsible, and to block all shipments to Israel, as part of the fight for a socialist program to overturn the capitalist order, the root source of war.

THREATS TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY Briefing ROSEMARY A. DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, noted that the tensions that have engulfed multiple countries in the Middle East continue to rise, with near daily incidents in the region since mid-October 2023 \u2014 including some 165 attacks on United States facilities in Syria and Iraq, prompting American strikes in the two countries.  Then, on 28 January, a drone attack killed three United States service members and injured 40 in north-east Jordan.  She recalled that on 2 February, United States Central Command said it had carried out 85 air strikes in Iraq and Syria against reported Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Forces and affiliated groups.  Syria and Iraq condemned those strikes, she noted, claiming they had resulted in deaths and injured civilians, while the United States said it had targeted command and control operations, intelligence centres and weapons facilities and was not seeking conflict in the Middle East or elsewhere. While Baghdad has continued to repeat its commitment to protecting United States and coalition forces inside Iraq, some armed factions linked to the \u201cIslamic Resistance in Iraq\u201d have pledged to continue their attacks against United States and coalition forces in the region.  She further noted that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and Hizbullah have exchanged fire across the Blue Line on an almost daily basis since 8 October.  Ongoing Houthi drone and missile attacks and threats to navigation in the Red Sea are deeply worrying and risk both exacerbating the conflict and further impacting international trade.  Recalling that since 11 January, the United States and the United Kingdom, with the backing of six other Member States, have launched strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen, she reiterated the Secretary-General\u2019s call on all parties to step back from the brink. She noted that it has been nearly five months since more than 1,200 Israelis were killed in the attacks by Hamas, with over 250 people taken hostage \u2014 a period of heartache and anguish for Israelis \u2014 echoing the Secretary-General\u2019s call for their immediate and unconditional release. She further emphasized that the past five months have also been heartbreaking and catastrophic for Palestinian civilians in Gaza, where \u201chunger is rampant, disease is spreading and shelter is squalid at best for a vast number of people\u201d.  The death toll in the Gaza Strip is reported to have surpassed 27,000, with thousands more reported missing.  The civilian population of Gaza should not pay for the terror unleashed by Hamas, she stated, reiterating the Secretary-General\u2019s call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. She affirmed that the risk of escalation in the Middle East, and its potential consequences, was obvious from 7 October, as a quick survey of the agenda of the Council explains why:  the United Nations is supporting political and peace processes throughout the region, in countries emerging, or still suffering, from armed conflict.  Long-term regional stability demands the implementation of a clear political road map in each situation, while the Secretary-General continues his extensive outreach to all key stakeholders to urge all parties to take concrete measures to de-escalate tensions and to work towards sustainable political solutions that aim to resolve, rather than merely manage, long-standing conflicts.  She appealed to the Council to continue to actively engage all concerned parties to prevent further escalation and the worsening of tensions that undermine regional peace and security. Statements Statement by the Russian Federation to come. The representative of Sierra Leone condemned the unprovoked attacks on and killing of the three United States military personnel on 28 January, leading to retaliatory air strikes against targets in Iraq and Syria.  There cannot be any justification for the unprovoked attacks or for Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.  He further called for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza and for dialogue by all relevant stakeholders in the region in order to avoid a spillover of the conflict in Gaza to the wider Middle East.  In light of recent developments, he urged relevant stakeholders and parties to work with the United Nations in the spirit of cooperation, humanity and diplomacy to prevent further deterioration in the humanitarian and security situation in the region. The representative of China said that the recent United States air strikes on multiple locations in Syria and Iraq have caused heavy casualties.  Those acts constitute a grave violation of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria and Iraq, he underscored, opposing any act that violates the Charter of the United Nations.  \u201cWho is creating threats, whether in the Middle East or elsewhere?\u201d he asked, adding that it is not right \u201cto let the strongest fist have the final say\u201d. The United States claims that its actions were in response to the attacks on its military to safeguard its own security.  Iraq and Syria have, however, already voiced strong condemnation.  The United States purports that it does not seek to create conflict in the Middle East; however, in reality, it does the opposite. History has repeatedly shown that military means is not the solution, he cautioned, noting that the actions by the United States will exacerbate the vicious cycle of violence in the Middle East. Underneath the rising tensions in the Middle East in the past few months is the failure to implement the ceasefire in Gaza, he pointed out, noting that \u201cwe are now standing at a critical crossroad \u2014 at stake is the critical future of our world\u201d. The representative of Algeria stressed that the Middle East \u201cis at the precipice of collapse\u201d, with the air strikes on Iraq and Syria further exacerbating the situation.  He voiced support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both countries, whose people deserve peace and prosperity.  Urging restraint and avoidance of escalation, he stated that the region cannot bear the burden of additional tensions \u201cand force is not and will never be the means for peace and stability\u201d.  He called for setting aside violence deterrence and punishment, as stability in the Middle East requires addressing root causes \u2014 with the Palestinian situation standing as the cornerstone of that endeavour. Noting that his country has repeatedly sounded alarm of regional spillover, he stated that the people of the Middle East yearn for peace, for development and prosperity, and \u201cit is high time for this cradle of civilization to reclaim its stability\u201d, requiring an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The representative of the United Kingdom fully supported all efforts to maintain and enhance international peace and security, including in Iraq and Syria.  \u201cWe are employing all diplomatic and security tools to seek the de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East,\u201d she asserted, condemning the multiple attacks since October 2023 by Iran-aligned militant groups on the Global Coalition against Da\u2019esh and Iraqi military bases in Syria and Iraq.  Despite warnings, those strikes have continued and intensified with an attack on 28 January killing three United States personnel and injuring many more.  Expressing full support for the right of Washington, D.C., to self-defence, she said that the Global Coalition has one objective:  to counter Da\u2019esh. Da\u2019esh continues to pose a grave threat to the wider region and conducted its biggest attack in years last month in Iran.  \u201cIts ability to direct, enable and inspire attacks continues to represent one of the most significant global terrorist threats,\u201d she warned.  Iran\u2019s political, financial and military support to militant groups is destabilizing the region and threatens the collective ability to counter Da\u2019esh.  Condemning the Houthis\u2019 continued attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea, she said:  \u201cOur actions and presence in the Red Sea are designed to protect innocent lives, preserve freedom of navigation and deter further attacks on shipping\u201d.  Alongside its United States allies, the United Kingdom acted in self-defence and in accordance with international law, she emphasized. The representative of Malta voiced concern that instability in the Middle East is being exploited by militias and armed groups to engage in activities that compound instability \u2014 with the rapidly deteriorating maritime situation in the Red Sea being a case in point.  She called on the Houthis to cease any attacks, underlining the need to avoid any further escalation.  She urged all parties to combat the malign intentions of all bad actors, which could contribute to a wider war.  The international community and the Council must work towards addressing the root causes of regional tensions and promote avenues towards a just and lasting peace.  She noted that acts of terrorism have often been used to exacerbate tensions by people not operating in good faith, and the Council has a key role to play, calling for initiatives to hold spoilers to account. Statement by the United States to come. The representative of the Republic of Korea voiced serious concern over the regional escalation since the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas and Israel\u2019s subsequent military operations in the Gaza Strip.  Further, the Houthis have continued their indiscriminate attacks on merchant and commercial vessels, jeopardizing the free flow of commerce in the Red Sea.  He noted measures taken by United States forces to limit the risk of escalation in defending their personnel and facilities. \u201cAbove all, at this volatile moment, when miscalculation can unintendedly lead to a tinderbox, any attempts to politically exploit the situation and risk regional stability are unacceptable,\u201d he stressed.  Recalling significant achievements in the political and security areas made by the Iraqi people, he called them \u201cprecious achievements\u201d, which must be upheld.  At the same time, as the current security and humanitarian situations in Syria remain extremely dire, the UN and humanitarian agencies\u2019 engagement should be ramped up to deliver live-saving humanitarian assistance. The representative of Ecuador voiced concern over the escalation of violence in the Middle East in recent weeks which puts the lives of the civilian population at risk.  The Council has the key responsibility to lay the foundation for sustainable peace in the region, he emphasized.  The attacks on 2 February on a number of cities in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for the attack on 28 January in Jordan have cost the lives of dozens of civilians and military personnel.  Calling on all parties to show restraint and comply with international law, he echoed the Secretary-General\u2019s appeal for restraint and encouraged any efforts aimed at de-escalation of tension.  He also reaffirmed the urgent need to guarantee humanitarian access. The representative of Slovenia expressed a growing feeling of powerlessness against the increasing spillover of the Gaza conflict into the wider region.  The Global Coalition\u2019s presence in Iraq is under growing threat from intensified attacks, which could undo the progress achieved in the country, while the situation in Syria is deteriorating.  He affirmed that the best hope to stop the spiral of violence is to restore calm in Gaza \u2014 \u201ccall it as you like\u201d, but the bombing, shelling and killing in Gaza, as well as over Israel, must stop, hostages must be released and urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance must be restored in full.  He urged all actors in the region to work towards de-escalation, calling on those countries who can exert influence on non-State groups to use it. The representative of Japan noted that Washington, D.C., stated that it carried out the air strikes against facilities of Iran-affiliated militants and other groups in Iraq and Syria, following the attack on United States troops in Jordan, to put an end to those continued attacks.  Japan is also aware that the United States does not seek a wider conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else.  Expressing deep concern that a number of non-State armed groups, militias and terrorists have been launching attacks and have signaled that they will intensify their hostile activities, he called upon all parties to refrain from any kind of destabilizing actions such as the transfer of weapons, including missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, and other military-related technologies to such non-State actors.  \u201cOur world is at a crossroads; we must choose the path towards peace, not war,\u201d he stressed. The representative of Switzerland expressed concern about the escalation that has been taking place in the region since the start of hostilities in Gaza, and which has reached a dangerous point with the events of the last 10 days.  This has been the case not only in Syria and Iraq, but also along the Blue Line and in the Red Sea, he added.  \u201cThere is a real risk to international peace and security in the region,\u201d he warned, calling on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation.  Noting that a single miscalculation can have \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d, he said it is vital to calm the situation to achieve regional de-escalation as quickly as possible.  To this end, a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is necessary.  Urging all parties to respect international law, he emphasized that the Council must play its full role in helping to de-escalate the situation and find political solutions to the conflicts in the region. The representative of France condemned the 28 January strikes targeting United States soldiers engaged in the fight against Da\u2019esh, which threatened the stability of the entire region.  France has been engaged in the fight against Da\u2019esh since 2014 and will continue to support the fight against terrorism led by the Iraqi authorities, in full respect of Iraq\u2019s sovereignty.  He further condemned the attack carried out using armed drones against a headquarters of Kurdish forces in December, voicing concern over the increase in violence in Syria.  There will be no prospect of a just and lasting solution there until a credible and inclusive political process is initiated.  He called on all parties to exercise restraint and for those with influence over groups that threaten the stability of the region to use it, from Yemen to Lebanon, including Iraq and Syria \u2014 further warning Iran against any attempt at regional escalation. The representative of Mozambique warned that the recent military confrontations in the region threaten peace and security in the entire world.  The retaliatory attacks in Yemen, Syria and Iraq aggravate the current cycle of confrontation and war that already prevails in the region.  These attacks are likely to escalate tensions, with negative spillover effects in the entire Middle East and beyond.  Also, he pointed out, they took place at a time when the United States, Qatar and Egypt were engaged in diplomatic contacts with the aim to end the devastating and bloody war between Israel and Hamas.  Faced with mounting tensions in the Middle East, it is important for all parties involved to urgently de-escalate tensions, avoid armed confrontation, engage in meaningful dialogue and work towards a peaceful long-term solution, he emphasized. The representative of Guyana, Council President for February, speaking in her national capacity, condemned the attacks that resulted in the deaths of three United States soldiers, voicing concern at reports of civilian losses in the response.  No effort should be spared to avert new threats and provocations, she said, urging all parties to respect international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.  There must be due respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, she stated, while the Council must not relent in the search for solutions to the current security challenges in the region \u2014 reiterating the call for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, where unprecedented numbers of Palestinians have been killed since 7 October.  The Council must unite to bring peace to Palestine and Israel and an end to this human tragedy. The representative of Syria stressed that Washington D.C.\u2019s aggression against his country constitutes a threat to regional and international peace and security, in blatant violation of international law.  \u201cThis aggression led to the martyrdom of 37 civilians and military personnel, and serious injury of 34 others, as well as the destruction of several civil residential buildings, a school and many civilian vehicles,\u201d he said.  Even historical sites \u2014 including the ancient Al-Rahba Citadel \u2014 were targeted.  \u201cThe United States is presenting a distorted interpretation of the UN Charter, especially Article 51, ignoring the fact that occupation has no right to self-defence, and that the root causes of conflicts, suffering, and instability in the region are the wrongful policies of the United States and its blind and unlimited support for the Israeli occupation entity,\u201d he asserted.  This includes the ongoing crime of genocide against the Palestinian people for more than 120 days, alongside Washington D.C.\u2019s support for terrorist groups, including Da\u2019esh and Al-Nusra Front/Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham. However, he emphasized that Washington D.C.\u2019s aggression \u2014 accompanied by the repeated Israeli attacks on the Syrian territories and the crimes of terrorist organizations and separatist militias \u2014 will not deter Syria from continuing its quest.  By all legitimate means, Syria will liberate its entire territory from the illegal foreign military presence, eliminate terrorism, restore State authority and the rule of law over its entire territories, and ensure security of its people.  Accordingly, he called on the United States to put an end to its illegal military presence on Syria\u2019s territory.  He also emphasized that the United States must refrain from causing further escalation in the region at a time when most Member States are working to stop war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide that Israel is committing against the Palestinian people. The representative of Iraq noted that the crises in the Middle East are linked and can undermine regional and international peace and security.  His country carries out a balanced foreign policy on the basis of solid relations with the regional area.  That is reflected in the regional and international opening of Iraq, over the past two years working to become a source of stability, practicing good neighbourliness and non-interference in internal affairs.  This pragmatic approach has bridged differences and ensured rapprochement in the region. He noted that Iraq is suffering from allied friendly and neighbouring countries\u2019 attacks, which undermine its sovereignty and territorial integrity.  While reaffirming its concern to protect and strengthen such bilateral relations, he condemned and categorically rejected any attack against several areas within its territory, which have led to loss of life and injuries, undermining sovereignty and territorial integrity.  He further rejected attacks on its military bases, or the use of its territory to be used for score settling or for policies to be rolled out, condemning the United States attacks targeting military positions, which led to dozens of deaths among personnel and civilians.  He reiterated the importance of the Council to shoulder its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, to combat all violations and ensure respect for the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The representative of Iran strongly condemned Washington D.C.\u2019s illegal military attacks on the territory of Iraq and Syria, as well as the joint military actions of the United States and the United Kingdom against Yemen.  The two countries must bear their international responsibility for their commission of the crime of aggression, he asserted, noting that their invocation of Article 51 as a basis for these aggressions lacks a solid legal foundation.  The United States continues to occupy Syria, loot Syrian resources, and support separatists and terrorist groups.  Furthermore, people in Syria are experiencing economic hardship and a humanitarian crisis as a result of Washington D.C.\u2019s hostile actions, as well as the imposition of illegal sanctions.  In Iraq, following their unlawful military intervention in 2003, the United States and the so-called \u201ccoalition\u201d ignored Iraqi aspirations and continued their illegal presence under the guise of fighting terrorism, he observed, calling on the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to withdraw their forces from the country. Rejecting the baseless accusations against Iran, he stressed that his country never seeks to contribute to the spillover in the region.  It has no military presence in Iraq, nor does it have bases or military advisers.  In Syria, Iranian military advisers are legally present since they were invited officially by Syria\u2019s Government to fight terrorism.  \u201cIt is evident to everyone that the root causes of the current situation in the region are occupation, aggression, and the continued genocide and horrific atrocities committed by the Israeli regime and fully supported by the [United States] against innocent Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank,\u201d he pointed out. Accordingly, the only solution to end the conflict in the region and prevent the spillover of the war is to force Israel to stop the genocide in Gaza, establish an immediate ceasefire, and end the presence of United States forces in Iraq and Syria. __________ * The 9541st Meeting was closed.

People take part in a \u201cMarch For Palestine\u201d in London on Saturday. Henry Nichols/AFP via Getty Images As a young adult I read Kafka\u2019s novel, \u2018The Castle\u2019. In trying to get himself heard, the protagonist is repeatedly blocked by layers of impotent clerks and ministers, as he attempts the impossible task, of trying to communicate with a regime that has elevated itself beyond reach of the ordinary person. This scenario appears to have been replicated within our current experience of dealing with government and corporations. The government and the people have grown so far apart that communication between them has all but ceased. When government leaders isolate themselves in an ivory tower, where the only voices are those of \u2018stake holder capitalists\u2019 or \u2018special interest lobbyists\u2019, it becomes self-evident that the government, in abandoning its pledge to serve the people, has turned its face away and looks only toward those with power and influence. Name: Email: This distance between the values of people and the moral bankruptcy of the government has never been more apparent. When we examine the behaviour of Cabinet Ministers, who openly declare their ongoing support of Israel, there is a complete\u00a0 disconnect between them and the people. A captive, mainstream media under report the outrage of ordinary, decent people in the UK and around the world, who are marching in large numbers in an attempt to get government leaders to insist that Israel halts its crime of genocide of the Gazan population. Although the UK Government gives lip service by expressing concern for Palestinian lives, on closer examination their words and actions paint a starkly different picture. (The UK stands firmly with Israel \u2013 Israel is the victim and has a right to defend itself \u2013 Hamas is a terrorist organisation. The attack by Hamas on October 7th was Israel\u2019s 9/11. Hamas murdered babies and raped women.\u00a0 We have to cut our funding to UNWRA because some UNWRA employees were Hamas and involved in 7th October atrocities. Hezbollah is a terrorist organisation controlled by Iran.) These allegations, regularly made by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and other high level ministers, would appear to be based on Israeli and US, \u2018say so\u2019, without any credible evidence \u2013 stories fabricated in order to justify the level of genocidal violence. As millions of\u00a0 people around the world cry out for justice and for an end to this slaughter, the \u2018Ansar Allah \u2013 Party of God\u2019, Yemeni Resistance Movement, took a proactive stance in their support for the Gazan people. They have blocked shipping to and from Israel through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, and will not allow the ships through until food and medical supplies are allowed into Gaza. Most people would conclude that this is not an unreasonable request given that the Gazans are, not only dealing with the relentless bombing by Israel, but are facing cold harsh conditions and starvation. \u2018Hansard parliamentary debate 23rd January 2024: It was reported that in response to the\u00a0 actions of the Yemeni resistance movement Rishi Sunak said ; (\u2018there is no link between our actions of self defence in the Red Sea and the situation in Israel/Gaza. Those who make that link do the Houthis\u2019 work for them and I want to be clear that those here at home who glorify the Houthis\u2019 attacks are glorifying terrorism plain and simple. They will be met with a zero tolerance approach.\u2019) No link? That is a blatant lie to justify the government\u2019s actions of bombing, yet another civilian population. Was this threat of zero tolerance for speaking the truth directed at us \u2013 the people, or was the threat primarily spoken as a warning to those MP\u2019s participating in the debate? While some brave MP\u2019s have listened and attempted to raise constituents\u2019 concerns over the slaughter of Palestinians, Rishi Sunak, and other cabinet ministers, are deaf to the outrage many people are expressing. It was only a few months ago when Suella Braverman was Home Secretary, she threatened the British people by stating if anyone carried a Palestinian flag they would be arrested.The threat went unheeded and thousands have since protested the genocide in Gaza by marching through London and other British cities with Palestinian flags flying freely. I am shocked therefore, when our government leaders not only deliberately fail to understand why the Yemeni people have taken this stand, but, having accused them of terrorism, think bombing Yemen is a legitimate and legal action. While the Yemeni resistance movement has deliberately avoided killing anyone, Zionist Israel, despite repeated claims to the contrary, targets civilians. Who are the terrorists here? In international law genocide is not only considered to be the most serious crime a state can commit, it is also a serious crime to militarily and politically support those who are carrying out genocide. In international law an occupying power does not have a right to self-defence, while those who are subjected to a brutal occupation do have the right to defend themselves and to resist the occupying force by both peaceful and military means. All parties aware of genocide are required by international law to do everything in their power to bring an immediate halt to such activities. What the many resistance groups, whether Palestinian, Lebanese, Iraqi or Yemeni, are doing is within the legitimate framework of trying to halt the genocide in Gaza. On the contrary by blocking efforts to lift the aid embargo and by cutting the external relief as provided by UNWRA, Western powers are defying all decent boundaries and moral law by accelerating genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. Speaking in Parliament, Kenny MacAskill, linked the behaviour of the Houthis with the lifting of aid into Gaza. He also suggested that it would be better for government to address the root causes of the injustice in Gaza, rather than to just consider the manifestation of events on 7th October. His remarks elicited a sharp response from Sunak who made it plain that not only did he disagree with both of the statements made by MacAskill but that by bringing the \u2018plausible case of genocide\u2019 to the International Court of Justice, what South Africa had done was not helpful. Does Rishi Sunak not know that in 1917 the British Government betrayed the Palestinian people by promising their country to another people? That from the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Palestinians, beginning with the Nakba (catastrophe), have experienced an ongoing terror campaign where their land and freedom has been systematically stolen from them.\u00a0 How is it possible that the UK Government, not only continues to support these crimes by supplying moral and military support to Israel, but have also stated they will cut all funding to UNWRA. The people of Gaza are not only being bombed, herded from their homes and then bombed again, they are facing an urgent lack of medical supplies/help, shelter, food and potable water. Very soon disease and starvation will make survivability in Gaza impossible. Already over 100,000 people have either been murdered or seriously injured. Over 800 serving officials in US and Europe have signed a statement warning that their government policies on Israel-Gaza could amount to \u2018grave violations\u2019 of international law. If we are to remain human this blatant sadistic cruelty by our government and other Western leaders should urgently be brought before the International Court of Justice for the crime of supporting genocide. As if supporting the bombing of Gaza and bombing Yemen were not enough the government are preparing us for a war against Russia. They monitor us online for \u2018hate speech\u2019 claiming that legitimate criticism of Israeli crimes incites violence, yet at every opportunity they demonise Putin and the Iranian leadership. We all recall how the demonisation of the Taliban, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi, Assad, Soleimani and others led to assassinations and/or bombs being dropped on the civilian population of several countries. It isn\u2019t the people who incite violence or who share a hatred of the other, it is governments. People en-mass are\u00a0 rejecting\u00a0 the false narratives pumped out by the captive corporate mainstream press, where \u2018truth and morality\u2019 have been blatantly discarded in place of glaring, shameless propaganda. The UK Government, along with other Western Government\u00a0 leaders have not only lost contact with what people think, they have lost all moral and legal legitimacy to govern. It is as a way of trying to make sense of this ever widening divide between the government and the people, that has led me to examine historical examples of fascism in greater detail. \ufeff (Definition of Fascism- \u2018the merger of state and corporate power\u2019 . Benito Mussolini\u2026\u2026 \u2026\u2026One of the main tenets of fascism is propaganda where everything is inverted. The oppressor who in carrying out acts of terror against the oppressed becomes the victim, while the victim of oppression is labelled as the terrorist.The brutal acts of the oppressor are subscribed to the oppressed. In order for persecution of the oppressed to take place the persecuted have to be dehumanised- animal, savage, cockroach, ( Amalek ). The dominant group is described as morally superior while at the same time this dominant group that are also seen to be the greatest victims. Claiming the cloak of victim hood provides a protective cover for tyranny. The\u00a0 information, propagated by a captured mainstream corporate press is fake news whereas information/articles analysing or description of actual events, is labelled as conspiracy theory or fake news. Propaganda is especially directed at capturing the minds of children, whom the state tries to claim authority over, along with other vulnerable adults. Asking questions and putting forth an alternative view to that put out by government or mainstream press, while initially ridiculed, history informs us that as a country is taken further down the road of fascism, expressing an alternative view becomes criminalised and punishable. Threatening individuals with punishment if they fail to think as directed is aimed at creating widespread fear, distrust, self censorship. At the same time virtue signalling is encouraged with the ultimate goal of persuading others to inform on those who fail to comply. Communities have to be divided \u2013 the young against the old, women against men, white against black, black against white, Christian against Muslim, ( traditional orthodox Jew against Zionist ideologists) , and on it goes with the labelled groupings becoming ever smaller and more nuanced to the point where brother is pitted against brother, child against mother. Fear porn propaganda proliferates. The rallying call becomes louder and the demonisation and isolation of the other becomes an effective tool as the controlling measures tighten. Add to that intrusive surveillance, de-banking of dissident voices, control of speech, movement \u2013 checkpoints/barriers, and it is easy to understand how easily and quickly fascist ideology can flourish\u2026) What is different today is that fascism is no longer constrained by the borders of individual nation states. Banking, pharmaceuticals/chemicals and military are globalised. As we witness nation states, (particularly in the west), losing their cultural identity, their natural food self-sufficiency and their ultimate sovereignty over body, self and country, we see it being replaced by authoritarian globalised agendas, (zero tolerance, zero private ownership, geo engineering, fake food). These are policies that nobody has a voice in determining or has/or would ever vote for. Ultimately we are all Palestinians. What we allow to happen to our fellow humans today will eventually arrive at our own back door. Governments are not elected to enslave and abuse the sovereign rights of the people. Government needs to be open, transparent and above all accessible to the people so that Cabinet Ministers do not lose touch with those they are mandated to serve. For a free and independent people to flourish the wall surrounding Kafka\u2019s Castle need to be identified, penetrated and consciously dismantled stone by stone.

Conflicts have involved regional and global powers, leading to widespread instability and violence. Middle East Program The Islamists International Security Middle East and North Africa Israel Iran Image Credit The Middle East has been the most volatile part of the world since the mid-20th century, with multiple conflicts among disparate rivals. Some erupted over domestic disputes, others over regional competition, with spillover drawing in major world powers. Israel fought four major wars with Arab neighbors, including Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, between 1948 and 1973. But since the creation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the mid-1960s, it has increasingly faced challenges from militias or non-state actors, eventually also including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian territories, and the Houthis in Yemen. The militias became major military players in the 1980s, then evolved into influential political parties in the 1990s and 2000s. In the 21st\u00a0century, they have been the most consistent threat to Israel. The undercurrent in all these conflicts was the escalating tensions between the United States and Iran. By 2024, 10 conflicts flared across the region. Israel faced two frontlines in the south against Hamas and in the north against Hezbollah. Both were members of the so-called \u201cAxis of Resistance,\u201d a network of Shiite movements armed, trained, and financially supported by Iran. Tensions also played out between Israel and the wider Arab world. In Iraq and Syria, other Iranian-backed militias attacked US forces deployed to help contain the remnants of ISIS after the Islamic State collapsed in 2019. Yemen was involved in three wars\u2014a civil war at home, a regional confrontation with Saudi Arabia, and attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea. The undercurrent in all these conflicts was the escalating tensions between the United States and Iran. The following is the background on all ten conflicts. Israel and Hamas With the PLO sidelined after Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, tensions between the Palestinians and Israel deepened in the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank. The first\u00a0Intifada erupted in 1987 after an Israeli military truck killed four Palestinians in Gaza and lasted until 1993. The protests gave rise to Hamas, an Islamist movement that shifted the goals of the Palestinian movement. It decreed, \u201cThere is no solution for the Palestinian question except through jihad. Initiatives, proposals, and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors.\u201d The first Intifada ebbed with the 1993 peace agreement between Israel and the PLO. A second Intifada erupted in 2000 after the collapse of U.S.-led talks between Israel and the PLO at Camp David. Violent protests continued until 2005 when Israel withdrew unilaterally from Gaza. In the 2006 Palestinian elections, Hamas won the majority of seats in parliament in a major political upset over Fatah, the dominant PLO faction.\u00a0 Amid disputes among the Palestinians, Hamas seized control of Gaza while Fatah led the West Bank government. Hostility between Israel and Hamas flared into conflicts in 2008, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2021, 2022 and 2023. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas launched cross-border raids in the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. Israel\u2019s military response killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and destroyed more than half of Gaza\u2019s buildings. Israel and Hezbollah Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon in 1982 forced thousands of PLO fighters to flee to other countries. Its ongoing occupation sparked fury among Lebanon\u2019s Shiites and the creation of Hezbollah, a militia armed, trained, and aided by Iran. It was underground for a decade, then emerged to run for parliament in 1992. Hezbollah attacked Israeli forces throughout their eighteen-year occupation of Lebanon. Under pressure from suicide bombings and attacks, Israel opted to withdraw in 2000\u2014for the first time in the midst of a war without a peace agreement. At the time, then-Israeli Defense Minister Yitzak Rabin reflected, \u201cAmong the many surprises, and most of them not for the good, that came out of the war in Lebanon, the most dangerous is that the war let the Shiites out of the bottle. No one predicted it. I couldn\u2019t find any intelligence report.\u201d He added, \u201cIn my opinion, the Shiites have the potential for a kind of terrorism that we have not yet experienced.\u201d In 2006, a cross-border raid by Hezbollah sparked a 34-day war with Israel. For all the death and destruction, Hezbollah was able to rearm and rebuild. By 2024, it had an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles pointed at Israel. After the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Hezbollah launched more than 700 rockets or missiles into northern Israel in the first three months\u2014in sympathy with its Palestinian allies. Israel and Iran Israel and Iran had diplomatic and economic relations, including oil and arms dealings, until the monarchy was ousted in the 1979 revolution. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolutionary leader, condemned Israel as an \u201cenemy of Islam\u201d and the \u201cLittle Satan\u201d (while the United States was the \u201cGreat Satan). Despite a back-channel arms deal with Israel during Iran\u2019s eight-year war with Iraq, tensions steadily escalated. After President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in 2005 that Israel should be wiped off the map, Israeli Vice Prime Minister Shimon countered in 2006, \u201cThe president of Iran should remember that Iran can also be wiped off the map.\u201d Iran\u2019s threats persisted. In 2010, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tweeted , \u201cIsrael is a hideous entity in the Middle East which will undoubtedly be annihilated.\u201d Tensions have played out, particularly over Tehran\u2019s support for militias in the Axis of Resistance. Iran helped create Hezbollah and helped it become the largest in the Middle East and one of the largest non-state actors in the world. The Islamic Republic also armed and aided other militias\u2014a collection of Shiite militias under the rubric of the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq, local Muslim militias in Syria, both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the Palestinian Authority, and the Houthis in Yemen. All share the strategic objective of eliminating Israel. The biggest flashpoint has been Iran\u2019s nuclear program as it advanced over the decades. For decades, Israeli leaders have vowed to stop or destroy it. Between 2010 and 2012, four nuclear physicists were assassinated in covert operations; the father of Iran\u2019s nuclear program was assassinated in 2020. Iran claimed Israeli agents were responsible. Israel was also reportedly complicit in the Stuxnet virus that infected and delayed Iran\u2019s centrifuge program in 2010. Key Israeli leaders opposed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal brokered by the world\u2019s six major powers and were pleased when President Trump abandoned it in 2018. In his address to the UN General Assembly in 2023, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed, \u201cAs long as I\u2019m prime minister of Israel, I will do everything in my power to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.\u201d For decades, the 22 members of the Arab League vowed not to deal in any form with Israel until the creation of a Palestinian state. Israel and the Arab World For decades, the 22 members of the Arab League vowed not to deal in any form with Israel until the creation of a Palestinian state. The pact was broken when Egypt and Israel signed the Camp David Accords in 1978. In 1993, the PLO and Israel signed the Oslo Accord, which led to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza. It was intended to be a first step toward the creation of a Palestinian state, although all subsequent U.S.-led efforts failed to reach a final settlement. Jordan and Israel recognized each other in 1994. Between 2020 and 2021, the Abraham Accords led to phased normalization between Israel and Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and Sudan. But progress in normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia\u2014the guardian of Islam\u2019s holy places and the most stalwart of the Arab states\u2014stalled after the war between Hamas and Israel erupted in 2023. Three Houthi Wars in Yemen : The Houthi rebel movement emerged in the 1990s among a tribal Shiite sect committed to reviving cultural and religious traditions. After the Arab Spring uprising ended the 22-year rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen imploded politically. The civil war erupted in 2014 after Houthi insurgents seized Sanaa, the capital and power from the government supported by neighboring Saudi Arabia. The civil war went regional in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition imposed an economic blockade of Yemen and launched massive air strikes on Houthi-controlled areas. It supported the government that fled Sanaa. The conflict became a virtual proxy war between Saudi Arabia, a predominantly Sunni nation, and Iran, the largest Shiite country in the region, which had armed and aided the Houthis. The Saudi campaign continued into March 2023, when diplomacy led by Oman attempted to mediate a ceasefire. It stalled after the outbreak of the war in Gaza. In October 2023, the Houthis launched a third front on commercial shipping in the Red Sea, a strategic waterway through which almost a third of international shipping passes en route to the Suez Canal. They claimed the drone and missile campaign was in support of their allies in Hamas, although the vast majority of ships targeted had no connections to Israel. The United States responded by mobilizing two international coalitions. Operation Prosperity Guardian committed to protecting international shipping. Operation Poseidon Archer intercepted Houthi drones and missiles over the Red Sea and attacked their military sites in Yemen. Iran Proxy Attacks on US Forces in Iraq, Syria, and Jordan The United States continued to deploy military forces to contain the remnants of the Islamic State after it collapsed in Iraq (in 2017) and Syria (in 2019). The separate missions were to advise and assist local forces\u2014the Iraqi military and the Syrian Democratic Forces. Various Iranian-backed proxies launched sporadic attacks aimed at forcing the United States to withdraw from both countries. The campaigns escalated after the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023. Between October and January 2024, the militias attacked US forces more than 160 times\u2014more than 90 on multiple US positions in Syria and more than 60 on multiple US positions in Iraq. The campaign opened on a new front on Jan. 28, 2024, when a member of Iran\u2019s Axis of Resistance launched a drone on a US outpost in Jordan, along the border abutting Syria and Iraq. Three Americans were killed and more than 40 injured. They were the first Americans killed under fire in the Middle East since the beginning of the Gaza war. The Biden administration blamed the Axis of Resistance and vowed retribution. Tensions between Washington and Tehran date back to the 1979 revolution that converted Iran from a U.S.-backed monarchy to an anti-American theocracy. Iran and the United States Tensions between Washington and Tehran date back to the 1979 revolution that converted Iran from a U.S.-backed monarchy to an anti-American theocracy. The revolution was as much about ending US influence as ousting the Shah. Hostilities peaked in November 1979 after the seizure of the American embassy in Tehran, when 52 US diplomats were held for 444 days. The flashpoint was the Carter administration\u2019s decision to take in the ousted Shah, which triggered Iranian fears that Washington was organizing a repeat of the U.S.-orchestrated coup against a democratically elected government in 1953, which allowed the Shah to return to the Peacock throne. Hostilities deepened over the decades as Iran fostered a network of new militias to attack American targets\u2014and drive up the human, military, and political cost of staying in the Middle East. The 1982 bombing of U.S. Marine peacekeepers in Lebanon, carried out by the embryo of Hezbollah, was the single deadliest incident for the US military since Iwo Jima in World War Two. The Lebanese militia fostered and trained by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, also carried out suicide attacks against three US Embassies\u2014in 1983 and 1984 in Beirut and 1983 in Kuwait. US actions also infuriated Iran. The Reagan administration provided intelligence and strategic advice to Iraq during the eight-year war in the 1980s. In 1988, the US Vincennes shot down an Iran Air passenger plane flying over the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 on board. From the mid-1990s to the mid-2010s, overtures by both countries attempted to defuse tensions. In 1995, President Hashemi Rafsanjani offered Conoco the largest oil deal ever brokered, but the Clinton administration instead blocked the deal and imposed a ban on any purchases, directly or through intermediaries, by American companies. In 1998, President Mohammad Khatami appealed for a shift in policy by both sides. \u201cThere must first be a crack in this wall of mistrust to prepare for a change and create an opportunity to study a new situation,\u201d he said. The Clinton administration responded by lifting sanctions on carpets, caviar, and pistachios. After the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in 2001, US and Iranian diplomats collaborated in brokering a new government in Afghanistan when the Taliban was ousted. But relations soured again in 2002 when President George W. Bush dubbed Iran\u2014along with Iraq and North Korea \u2013an \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d in his state-of-the-union address. US officials subsequently blamed Iran for providing arms to militias in Afghanistan and Iraq that killed US forces. Tensions escalated over the first quarter of the 21st\u00a0century over Iran\u2019s sporadic seizure of American hostages, who were held on vague charges of threats to national security or espionage, as well as the advances in Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. Between 2006 and 2013, the US imposed waves of sanctions for the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear program, support for terrorism, and human rights abuses. Within a month of his election, President Hassan Rouhani signaled an interest in a nuclear deal with the world. He took a call from President Barack Obama when he was at the United Nations, which opened the way for the most significant diplomacy since the revolution. After two years of difficult diplomacy with the world\u2019s six major powers, Iran agreed to a deal limiting its program in exchange for the UN, US, and European Union lifting the sanctions related to its nuclear advances. The tide turned in 2018 when President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal and imposed a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign that included more than 1,500 economic sanctions. Washington also formally labeled the Revolutionary Guards a \u201cforeign terrorist group,\u201d the first time the United States ever sanctioned an entire military. The goals were to force Iran to renegotiate broader limits on its nuclear program, end support for extremist militias, and halt human rights abuses. Supreme Leader Khamenei countered, \u201cEven if we ever\u2014impossible as it is\u2014negotiated with the US, it would never ever be with the current US administration.\u201d In 2020, Trump ordered the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani, the Quds Force commander, after an Iranian-backed militia killed an American contractor working in Iraq. \u201cGeneral Suleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more,\u201d the Pentagon said. The attack carried out as Soleimani visited Baghdad, also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of Kataib Hezbollah, the leading Iraqi militia allied with Iran. It unleashed 11 ballistic missiles\u2014each with a 1,000-pound warhead\u2014on US forces based at Al Asad airbase in Iraq. More than 100 suffered traumatic brain injuries. The Iranian parliament also passed a law that labeled the Pentagon and all US military \u201cterrorists.\u201d After his inauguration in 2021, President Biden attempted to revive the nuclear deal with support from the five other world powers\u2014Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia\u2014still signatories to the pact. Diplomatic talks resumed in Europe, although Iran refused to talk directly to its US counterparts. Negotiations appeared close to agreement, but Iran balked at the final text in August 2022. Diplomacy collapsed. Iran\u2019s nuclear program made significant leaps in its nuclear program, especially in the amount of enriched uranium used to fuel a weapon. US experts and Israeli intelligence estimated in 2023 that Iran had enough fuel to build a bomb within weeks\u2014if it made the political decision to cross that threshold. After the war in Gaza between Hamas and Israel erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, Iranian-backed militias increased missile and drone attacks on US targets in Iraq and\u00a0 Syria and on naval and commercial ships in the Red Sea. From October through January 2024, various armed factions launched more than 160 attacks on multiple US sites in Syria and Iraq and 30 on targets in the Red Sea. On Jan. 28, a drone attack on a US military outpost in Jordan marked a major escalation. Three American soldiers were killed and more than 40 injured. President Biden vowed military retribution. Tensions between the US and Iran reached unprecedented hostilities, with a rippling impact across all the other conflicts in the Middle East.

THREATS TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY Briefing ROSEMARY A. DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, noted that the tensions that have engulfed multiple countries in the Middle East continue to rise, with near daily incidents in the region since mid-October 2023 - including some 165 attacks on United States facilities in Syria and Iraq, prompting American strikes in the two countries. Then, on 28 January, a drone attack killed three United States service members and injured 40 in north-east Jordan. She recalled that on 2 February, United States Central Command said it had carried out 85 air strikes in Iraq and Syria against reported Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Forces and affiliated groups. Syria and Iraq condemned those strikes, she noted, claiming they had resulted in deaths and injured civilians, while the United States said it had targeted command and control operations, intelligence centres and weapons facilities and was not seeking conflict in the Middle East or elsewhere. While Baghdad has continued to repeat its commitment to protecting United States and coalition forces inside Iraq, some armed factions linked to the \"Islamic Resistance in Iraq\" have pledged to continue their attacks against United States and coalition forces in the region. She further noted that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and Hizbullah have exchanged fire across the Blue Line on an almost daily basis since 8 October. Ongoing Houthi drone and missile attacks and threats to navigation in the Red Sea are deeply worrying and risk both exacerbating the conflict and further impacting international trade. Recalling that since 11 January, the United States and the United Kingdom, with the backing of six other Member States, have launched strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen, she reiterated the Secretary-General's call on all parties to step back from the brink. She noted that it has been nearly five months since more than 1,200 Israelis were killed in the attacks by Hamas, with over 250 people taken hostage - a period of heartache and anguish for Israelis - echoing the Secretary-General's call for their immediate and unconditional release. She further emphasized that the past five months have also been heartbreaking and catastrophic for Palestinian civilians in Gaza, where \"hunger is rampant, disease is spreading and shelter is squalid at best for a vast number of people\". The death toll in the Gaza Strip is reported to have surpassed 27,000, with thousands more reported missing. The civilian population of Gaza should not pay for the terror unleashed by Hamas, she stated, reiterating the Secretary-General's call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. She affirmed that the risk of escalation in the Middle East, and its potential consequences, was obvious from 7 October, as a quick survey of the agenda of the Council explains why: the United Nations is supporting political and peace processes throughout the region, in countries emerging, or still suffering, from armed conflict. Long-term regional stability demands the implementation of a clear political road map in each situation, while the Secretary-General continues his extensive outreach to all key stakeholders to urge all parties to take concrete measures to de-escalate tensions and to work towards sustainable political solutions that aim to resolve, rather than merely manage, long-standing conflicts. She appealed to the Council to continue to actively engage all concerned parties to prevent further escalation and the worsening of tensions that undermine regional peace and security. Statements Statement by the Russian Federation to come. The representative of Sierra Leone condemned the unprovoked attacks on and killing of the three United States military personnel on 28 January, leading to retaliatory air strikes against targets in Iraq and Syria. There cannot be any justification for the unprovoked attacks or for Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. He further called for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza and for dialogue by all relevant stakeholders in the region in order to avoid a spillover of the conflict in Gaza to the wider Middle East. In light of recent developments, he urged relevant stakeholders and parties to work with the United Nations in the spirit of cooperation, humanity and diplomacy to prevent further deterioration in the humanitarian and security situation in the region. The representative of China said that the recent United States air strikes on multiple locations in Syria and Iraq have caused heavy casualties. Those acts constitute a grave violation of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria and Iraq, he underscored, opposing any act that violates the Charter of the United Nations. \"Who is creating threats, whether in the Middle East or elsewhere?\" he asked, adding that it is not right \"to let the strongest fist have the final say\". The United States claims that its actions were in response to the attacks on its military to safeguard its own security. Iraq and Syria have, however, already voiced strong condemnation. The United States purports that it does not seek to create conflict in the Middle East; however, in reality, it does the opposite. History has repeatedly shown that military means is not the solution, he cautioned, noting that the actions by the United States will exacerbate the vicious cycle of violence in the Middle East. Underneath the rising tensions in the Middle East in the past few months is the failure to implement the ceasefire in Gaza, he pointed out, noting that \"we are now standing at a critical crossroad - at stake is the critical future of our world\". The representative of Algeria stressed that the Middle East \"is at the precipice of collapse\", with the air strikes on Iraq and Syria further exacerbating the situation. He voiced support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both countries, whose people deserve peace and prosperity. Urging restraint and avoidance of escalation, he stated that the region cannot bear the burden of additional tensions \"and force is not and will never be the means for peace and stability\". He called for setting aside violence deterrence and punishment, as stability in the Middle East requires addressing root causes - with the Palestinian situation standing as the cornerstone of that endeavour. Noting that his country has repeatedly sounded alarm of regional spillover, he stated that the people of the Middle East yearn for peace, for development and prosperity, and \"it is high time for this cradle of civilization to reclaim its stability\", requiring an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The representative of the United Kingdom fully supported all efforts to maintain and enhance international peace and security, including in Iraq and Syria. \"We are employing all diplomatic and security tools to seek the de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East,\" she asserted, condemning the multiple attacks since October 2023 by Iran-aligned militant groups on the Global Coalition against Da'esh and Iraqi military bases in Syria and Iraq. Despite warnings, those strikes have continued and intensified with an attack on 28 January killing three United States personnel and injuring many more. Expressing full support for the right of Washington, D.C., to self-defence, she said that the Global Coalition has one objective: to counter Da'esh. Da'esh continues to pose a grave threat to the wider region and conducted its biggest attack in years last month in Iran. \"Its ability to direct, enable and inspire attacks continues to represent one of the most significant global terrorist threats,\" she warned. Iran's political, financial and military support to militant groups is destabilizing the region and threatens the collective ability to counter Da'esh. Condemning the Houthis' continued attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea, she said: \"Our actions and presence in the Red Sea are designed to protect innocent lives, preserve freedom of navigation and deter further attacks on shipping\". Alongside its United States allies, the United Kingdom acted in self-defence and in accordance with international law, she emphasized. The representative of Malta voiced concern that instability in the Middle East is being exploited by militias and armed groups to engage in activities that compound instability - with the rapidly deteriorating maritime situation in the Red Sea being a case in point. She called on the Houthis to cease any attacks, underlining the need to avoid any further escalation. She urged all parties to combat the malign intentions of all bad actors, which could contribute to a wider war. The international community and the Council must work towards addressing the root causes of regional tensions and promote avenues towards a just and lasting peace. She noted that acts of terrorism have often been used to exacerbate tensions by people not operating in good faith, and the Council has a key role to play, calling for initiatives to hold spoilers to account. Statement by the United States to come. The representative of the Republic of Korea voiced serious concern over the regional escalation since the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas and Israel's subsequent military operations in the Gaza Strip. Further, the Houthis have continued their indiscriminate attacks on merchant and commercial vessels, jeopardizing the free flow of commerce in the Red Sea. He noted measures taken by United States forces to limit the risk of escalation in defending their personnel and facilities. \"Above all, at this volatile moment, when miscalculation can unintendedly lead to a tinderbox, any attempts to politically exploit the situation and risk regional stability are unacceptable,\" he stressed. Recalling significant achievements in the political and security areas made by the Iraqi people, he called them \"precious achievements\", which must be upheld. At the same time, as the current security and humanitarian situations in Syria remain extremely dire, the UN and humanitarian agencies' engagement should be ramped up to deliver live-saving humanitarian assistance. The representative of Ecuador voiced concern over the escalation of violence in the Middle East in recent weeks which puts the lives of the civilian population at risk. The Council has the key responsibility to lay the foundation for sustainable peace in the region, he emphasized. The attacks on 2 February on a number of cities in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for the attack on 28 January in Jordan have cost the lives of dozens of civilians and military personnel. Calling on all parties to show restraint and comply with international law, he echoed the Secretary-General's appeal for restraint and encouraged any efforts aimed at de-escalation of tension. He also reaffirmed the urgent need to guarantee humanitarian access. The representative of Slovenia expressed a growing feeling of powerlessness against the increasing spillover of the Gaza conflict into the wider region. The Global Coalition's presence in Iraq is under growing threat from intensified attacks, which could undo the progress achieved in the country, while the situation in Syria is deteriorating. He affirmed that the best hope to stop the spiral of violence is to restore calm in Gaza - \"call it as you like\", but the bombing, shelling and killing in Gaza, as well as over Israel, must stop, hostages must be released and urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance must be restored in full. He urged all actors in the region to work towards de-escalation, calling on those countries who can exert influence on non-State groups to use it. The representative of Japan noted that Washington, D.C., stated that it carried out the air strikes against facilities of Iran-affiliated militants and other groups in Iraq and Syria, following the attack on United States troops in Jordan, to put an end to those continued attacks. Japan is also aware that the United States does not seek a wider conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else. Expressing deep concern that a number of non-State armed groups, militias and terrorists have been launching attacks and have signaled that they will intensify their hostile activities, he called upon all parties to refrain from any kind of destabilizing actions such as the transfer of weapons, including missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, and other military-related technologies to such non-State actors. \"Our world is at a crossroads; we must choose the path towards peace, not war,\" he stressed. The representative of Switzerland expressed concern about the escalation that has been taking place in the region since the start of hostilities in Gaza, and which has reached a dangerous point with the events of the last 10 days. This has been the case not only in Syria and Iraq, but also along the Blue Line and in the Red Sea, he added. \"There is a real risk to international peace and security in the region,\" he warned, calling on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation. Noting that a single miscalculation can have \"disastrous consequences\", he said it is vital to calm the situation to achieve regional de-escalation as quickly as possible. To this end, a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is necessary. Urging all parties to respect international law, he emphasized that the Council must play its full role in helping to de-escalate the situation and find political solutions to the conflicts in the region. The representative of France condemned the 28 January strikes targeting United States soldiers engaged in the fight against Da'esh, which threatened the stability of the entire region. France has been engaged in the fight against Da'esh since 2014 and will continue to support the fight against terrorism led by the Iraqi authorities, in full respect of Iraq's sovereignty. He further condemned the attack carried out using armed drones against a headquarters of Kurdish forces in December, voicing concern over the increase in violence in Syria. There will be no prospect of a just and lasting solution there until a credible and inclusive political process is initiated. He called on all parties to exercise restraint and for those with influence over groups that threaten the stability of the region to use it, from Yemen to Lebanon, including Iraq and Syria - further warning Iran against any attempt at regional escalation. The representative of Mozambique warned that the recent military confrontations in the region threaten peace and security in the entire world. The retaliatory attacks in Yemen, Syria and Iraq aggravate the current cycle of confrontation and war that already prevails in the region. These attacks are likely to escalate tensions, with negative spillover effects in the entire Middle East and beyond. Also, he pointed out, they took place at a time when the United States, Qatar and Egypt were engaged in diplomatic contacts with the aim to end the devastating and bloody war between Israel and Hamas. Faced with mounting tensions in the Middle East, it is important for all parties involved to urgently de-escalate tensions, avoid armed confrontation, engage in meaningful dialogue and work towards a peaceful long-term solution, he emphasized. The representative of Guyana, Council President for February, speaking in her national capacity, condemned the attacks that resulted in the deaths of three United States soldiers, voicing concern at reports of civilian losses in the response. No effort should be spared to avert new threats and provocations, she said, urging all parties to respect international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. There must be due respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, she stated, while the Council must not relent in the search for solutions to the current security challenges in the region - reiterating the call for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, where unprecedented numbers of Palestinians have been killed since 7 October. The Council must unite to bring peace to Palestine and Israel and an end to this human tragedy. The representative of Syria stressed that Washington D.C.'s aggression against his country constitutes a threat to regional and international peace and security, in blatant violation of international law. \"This aggression led to the martyrdom of 37 civilians and military personnel, and serious injury of 34 others, as well as the destruction of several civil residential buildings, a school and many civilian vehicles,\" he said. Even historical sites - including the ancient Al-Rahba Citadel - were targeted. \"The United States is presenting a distorted interpretation of the UN Charter, especially Article 51, ignoring the fact that occupation has no right to self-defence, and that the root causes of conflicts, suffering, and instability in the region are the wrongful policies of the United States and its blind and unlimited support for the Israeli occupation entity,\" he asserted. This includes the ongoing crime of genocide against the Palestinian people for more than 120 days, alongside Washington D.C.'s support for terrorist groups, including Da'esh and Al-Nusra Front/Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham. However, he emphasized that Washington D.C.'s aggression - accompanied by the repeated Israeli attacks on the Syrian territories and the crimes of terrorist organizations and separatist militias - will not deter Syria from continuing its quest. By all legitimate means, Syria will liberate its entire territory from the illegal foreign military presence, eliminate terrorism, restore State authority and the rule of law over its entire territories, and ensure security of its people. Accordingly, he called on the United States to put an end to its illegal military presence on Syria's territory. He also emphasized that the United States must refrain from causing further escalation in the region at a time when most Member States are working to stop war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide that Israel is committing against the Palestinian people. The representative of Iraq noted that the crises in the Middle East are linked and can undermine regional and international peace and security. His country carries out a balanced foreign policy on the basis of solid relations with the regional area. That is reflected in the regional and international opening of Iraq, over the past two years working to become a source of stability, practicing good neighbourliness and non-interference in internal affairs. This pragmatic approach has bridged differences and ensured rapprochement in the region. He noted that Iraq is suffering from allied friendly and neighbouring countries' attacks, which undermine its sovereignty and territorial integrity. While reaffirming its concern to protect and strengthen such bilateral relations, he condemned and categorically rejected any attack against several areas within its territory, which have led to loss of life and injuries, undermining sovereignty and territorial integrity. He further rejected attacks on its military bases, or the use of its territory to be used for score settling or for policies to be rolled out, condemning the United States attacks targeting military positions, which led to dozens of deaths among personnel and civilians. He reiterated the importance of the Council to shoulder its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, to combat all violations and ensure respect for the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The representative of Iran strongly condemned Washington D.C.'s illegal military attacks on the territory of Iraq and Syria, as well as the joint military actions of the United States and the United Kingdom against Yemen. The two countries must bear their international responsibility for their commission of the crime of aggression, he asserted, noting that their invocation of Article 51 as a basis for these aggressions lacks a solid legal foundation. The United States continues to occupy Syria, loot Syrian resources, and support separatists and terrorist groups. Furthermore, people in Syria are experiencing economic hardship and a humanitarian crisis as a result of Washington D.C.'s hostile actions, as well as the imposition of illegal sanctions. In Iraq, following their unlawful military intervention in 2003, the United States and the so-called \"coalition\" ignored Iraqi aspirations and continued their illegal presence under the guise of fighting terrorism, he observed, calling on the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to withdraw their forces from the country. Rejecting the baseless accusations against Iran, he stressed that his country never seeks to contribute to the spillover in the region. It has no military presence in Iraq, nor does it have bases or military advisers. In Syria, Iranian military advisers are legally present since they were invited officially by Syria's Government to fight terrorism. \"It is evident to everyone that the root causes of the current situation in the region are occupation, aggression, and the continued genocide and horrific atrocities committed by the Israeli regime and fully supported by the [United States] against innocent Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank,\" he pointed out. Accordingly, the only solution to end the conflict in the region and prevent the spillover of the war is to force Israel to stop the genocide in Gaza, establish an immediate ceasefire, and end the presence of United States forces in Iraq and Syria. /Public Release.

For now, this appears to be in keeping with the Biden administration\u2019s desire to avoid targeting Iran or Iranians specifically \u2014 a strategy that does little except feed Iranian confidence that its long-term proxy-driven attritional campaign against the US is working. In launching a wave of strikes on Iranian proxy militant targets in western Iraq and eastern Syria late on Feb. 2, the United States conducted the most expansive military action against Iran\u2019s militia network since the Iraq War \u2014 hitting 85 targets with 125 munitions. Of the 34 confirmed fatalities, all were locals, except four Afghan members of Liwa Fatemiyoun (an Afghan Shi\u2019a force founded and supported by Tehran).\u00a0The US attacks were in response to a Jan. 28 drone assault by Iranian militia forces in Syria that killed three American troops based in Jordan. Taken in isolation, the US strikes were unquestionably significant, but if the Biden administration hoped that Iran and its proxies would be deterred, they were wrong. Three new attacks targeting US troop positions were recorded the following day, on Feb. 3 (two in Syria and one in Iraq); and late on Feb. 4, an Iranian-made suicide drone precisely struck a building housing the US-trained commando unit of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) inside the al-Omar US military base in Deir ez-Zor, Syria. Seven SDF commandos were killed and 18 more injured. Beyond attacks, the entire Iranian proxy propaganda network swiftly returned to online service \u2014 disseminating threats, news, and attack claims \u2014 after having gone completely offline in the days prior to the strikes. The fact that it took five days for the strikes to occur ensured that all Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) personnel had evacuated, along with militia commanders and leaders. The only militia personnel left behind were night guards. While stores of Iranian-made drones and rockets were destroyed, Iran\u2019s most valuable assets \u2014 commanders and operatives \u2014 survived, safe to fight another day. For now, this appears to be in keeping with the Biden administration\u2019s desire to avoid targeting Iran or Iranians specifically \u2014 a strategy that does little except feed Iranian confidence that its long-term proxy-driven attritional campaign against the US is working. That the strikes were conducted by long-range B-1 bombers flown directly from California served to underline another Iranian advantage. Purposely avoiding the use of air or naval assets pre-positioned in bases across the Middle East was a clear recognition that America\u2019s regional allies and partners want no association with the strikes \u2014 out of concern that Tehran could direct its proxies to target them in response. Such attacks, whether launched from Iraq or Yemen, have happened before, and the resulting deterrent effect clearly remains to Iran\u2019s advantage. Follow on Twitter: @Charles_Lister Iraqi government balances desire to preserve military cooperation with US versus influence of local militias Randa Slim Senior Fellow and Director of Conflict Resolution and Track II Dialogues Program Until now, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani has been trying to balance between hardliners in his coalition who are calling for a quick withdrawal of US forces and others who see that a rupture in the US-Iraqi relationship will harm their economic interests. However, if the US bombing campaign against Tehran-backed militias continues to kill more Iraqis and eventually escalates to target Iranian personnel in or outside Iran, then Sudani\u2019s balancing act could become unsustainable. Last Friday, Feb. 2, the United States struck dozens of command-and-control as well as weapons storage and production facilities of Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Iraq, killing 16 people in the latter country. In its reaction to the US attack, the Iraqi state administration governing coalition, which includes leaders of several Iran-affiliated militias, notably struck a balanced tone. On one hand, it condemned the US targeting of bases of the Popular Mobilization forces (PMF), describing it in a statement as \u201ca serious attack on an official Iraqi security institution\u201d and \u201ca violation of Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and security and a transgression of international norms and law.\u201d Interestingly, however, it did not stridently comment on the US military presence in Iraq. Rather, the governing coalition expressed support for the ongoing bilateral dialogue regarding the potential withdrawal of US armed forces. The statement also rejected \u201call forms of attacks targeting Iraqi military bases as well as targeting military advisors from international coalition countries,\u201d which include US uniformed personnel. On Sunday, Feb. 4, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said , \u201cWe also want to see the Iraqi government move with more alacrity to help us rid the threat of these militia groups on Iraqi soil. \u2026these groups are operating with some manner of impunity on Iraqi soil.\u201d Like his predecessors, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani cannot get rid of these militias or force them to change their behavior; they answer to an Iranian agenda that is not Iraq-specific. As long as these militias\u2019 actions serve Tehran\u2019s agenda, there are severe limits to what the Iraqi government can do to rein them in. There are also severe limits to what the Iraqi public can do. When Iraqis rose up in October 2019, demanding a state that guarantees their security and respects their rights, and called on Iran to leave Iraq, Iran-affiliated Iraqi militias killed hundreds of Iraqi youth protesters. Those and more recent militia attacks have brought to the fore fears shared by many Iraqis that the security vacuum that will be created by the withdrawal of US forces will be filled by local Iran-aligned militias, thus strengthening their hold on the country. Until now, the Iraqi prime minister has been trying to balance between hardliners in his coalition who are calling for a quick withdrawal of US forces and others who see that a rupture in the US-Iraqi relationship will harm their economic interests. Hence, the prime minister\u2019s strategy has been to initiate discussions about ending the current mission of the coalition forces, including the US, while negotiating bilateral security relationship with the member states \u2014 again, including the US. The above-cited, carefully worded statement issued by the governing coalition following Friday\u2019s US attacks reflects this approach. However, if the US bombing campaign continues to kill more Iraqis and eventually escalates to target Iranian personnel in or outside Iran, then Prime Minister Sudani\u2019s balancing act could become unsustainable. On Feb. 5, Sudani met with Ali Akbar Ahmadian, the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, on the latter\u2019s first official visit to Iraq. The readout of the meeting from the prime minister\u2019s office stated , \u201cThe prime minister emphasized Iraq\u2019s rejection of any unilateral actions by any country \u2026 [and] Iraq\u2019s commitment to the principle of good neighborliness \u2026 but such pursuits should not compromise Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and security.\u201d It remains to be seen how the US bombing campaign will impact the Iran-aligned Iraqi militias\u2019 behavior. Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi militant group responsible for the attack on the US outpost in Jordan that killed three US soldiers, already suspended its targeting of American forces. But Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, another member of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella organization that includes several Iran-affiliated Iraqi militias, vowed to continue striking US troops in theater. The umbrella group has conditioned the end of its attacks on a cease-fire in Gaza. But the challenges these militias pose for Iraqi sovereignty predate the Gaza war and will continue after it ends. Follow on Twitter: @rmslim A long \u201cto-do\u201d list for Blinken\u2019s latest Middle East trip Brian Katulis Vice President of Policy US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is currently meeting leaders and counterparts across the region to reinforce ongoing diplomacy toward achieving a longer-term cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, secure the release of hostages held in Gaza, increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Palestinians, shore up the Palestinian Authority, and set a new framework for Israeli-Palestinian peace, among other aims. Juggling so many objectives at the same time has inherent risks: If everything is a priority, then nothing may end up being a top priority, making it difficult to achieve progress toward any of America\u2019s stated goals. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on his fifth trip this week to the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war began. The current itinerary plans to take him to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and the West Bank. The main focus is on helping advance a much-anticipated longer-term pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas in exchange for the release of more hostages held in the Gaza Strip. This latest visit comes after the United States stepped up its airstrikes against Iran-backed groups in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq in retaliation for attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and a drone strike that killed three US soldiers in Jordan last week. The Biden administration is hoping to avoid further regional escalation that would put the US more directly in conflict with Iran as it seeks to strike the right balance in its attacks on Iran-backed forces. These regional tensions shape the broader context for Blinken\u2019s ongoing diplomatic efforts, which so far have yielded limited progress. The Israel-Hamas war has raged for nearly four months, except for a one-week pause in fighting and release of hostages in late November. The humanitarian crisis inside of Gaza remains quite dire, and Biden\u2019s National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said this weekend that in addition to the other things Blinken will try to achieve, \u201ca top priority\u201d of the secretary of state in meeting the Israeli government is to make clear that \u201cthe needs of the Palestinian people [\u2026] are going to be front and center in the US approach and that we want to ensure that they are getting access to life saving food, medicine, water, [and] shelter.\u201d Additionally, the Biden administration wants to use a longer-term cease-fire to pursue wider Middle East peace deals, including a two-state solution that would somehow preserve the idea of a normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia as a prospect for 2024, an election year. US officials have apparently briefed columnists like Thomas Friedman and David Ignatius on quite grandiose visions of what might happen if the pieces fall into place for a cease-fire and hostage release. Ultimately, the facts on the ground, including the unpredictable dynamics of multiple conflicts in the Middle East and the will, intentions, and capacities of the main combatants, will determine whether any of these designs ultimately succeed. Blinken\u2019s latest diplomatic shuffle across the region has high ambitions and a long to-do list, but juggling so many objectives at the same time presents inherent risks. If everything is a priority, then nothing may end up being a top priority, making it difficult to achieve progress toward any of America\u2019s many objectives. Follow on Twitter: @Katulis Biden\u2019s executive order on settler terror is potentially far-reaching Khaled Elgindy Senior Fellow, Director of Program on Palestine and Palestinian-Israeli Affairs Israeli settler terrorism in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem has reached unprecedented levels since Oct. 7, with nearly 500 attacks against Palestinians, killing at least eight and injuring more than 117 others as well as displacing some 1,200. President Joe Biden\u2019s executive order allowing the US to sanction perpetrators of this violence could have far-reaching implications if it is not too narrowly applied, and particularly if it is combined with new foreign terrorist organization (FTO) designations against extremist groups. Last Thursday, Feb. 1, President Joe Biden signed an executive order allowing the United States to impose new sanctions on individual Israeli settlers involved in terrorism and other violent attacks against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, presumably including East Jerusalem. White House officials say Israeli settler violence of this sort in the Occupied Territories has reached \u201cintolerable\u201d levels. The order freezes the US-based assets and bank accounts of designated individuals and prohibits trade or financial transactions with them, as well as bars them from entering the United States. Settler terrorism, which had already spiked throughout 2023, has reached unprecedented levels since Oct. 7. Extremist Israeli settlers have carried out nearly 500 attacks against Palestinians since Oct. 7, killing at least eight Palestinians, including a child, and injuring more than 117 others, according to the United Nations . Settler terrorism has also led to the displacement of some 1,200 Palestinians. Biden\u2019s executive order names four individuals implicated in recent violent attacks on Palestinians, including the February 2023 settler pogrom on the northern West Bank village of Huwara, in which one Palestinian was killed. While some have described the move as \u201cthe most significant step any U.S. administration has ever taken\u201d to confront settler terrorism, previous administrations have taken the considerably more powerful step of designating Israeli extremist groups as foreign terrorist organizations (FTO). In 1995, President Bill Clinton designated two of them, Kach and Kahane Chai, both inspired by the radical rabbi Meir Kahane, as FTOs. Ironically, it was the Biden administration that removed both groups from the FTO list in May 2022, just months before Itamar Ben-Gvir\u2019s Otzma Yehudit (\u201cJewish Power\u201d) Party, an offshoot of the Kahanist movement, joined the ruling coalition. Nevertheless, last week\u2019s measure could have potentially far-reaching implications for settler violence and the settler movement as whole if additional individuals are added \u2014 particularly if they include Israeli politicians and government officials, given the close cooperation between the Israeli army, government ministries, and violent settlers. In meantime, as long as this potentially powerful tool is narrowly applied to only a handful of individuals, and particularly in the absence of new FTO designations, the executive order is unlikely to have a significant impact on the ground. Follow on Twitter: @elgindy_ Pre-electoral machinations in Pakistan Syed Mohammad Ali Non-Resident Scholar While former Prime Minister Imran Khan has been removed as a challenger, the exact contours of the power structure likely to emerge from the Feb. 8 elections are as yet unclear. No matter what the exact outcome, the military will remain a key power broker, exerting even more influence on Pakistan\u2019s foreign, economic, and domestic security policies. With elections scheduled for Feb. 8, the political drama in Pakistan is in a frenzied state right now. While the electoral stage has been set in the broader sense, the jostling between a medley of ambitious politicians is on full display. The fact that former Prime Minister Imran Khan was going to be kept off the \u201cpavilion\u201d this time around has already been assured by his imprisonment and ban from public office; what remains uncertain is what the exact contours of the emergent power structure will be. Here we need to consider the numbers game. For instance, will the military establishment\u2019s currently favored (and last time around most disfavored) political party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), manage to secure a clear majority in parliament, or not? Whether the PML-N forms a coalition with the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) will depend on how well the PPP does beyond its long-time power base in the province of Sindh. The PPP scion, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, foreign minister under the Shehbaz Sharif-led PML-N government that followed Imran Khan\u2019s ouster, makes that a possibility with precedent. Such a coalition would undoubtedly be shaky, and it is also unlikely given that disgruntled liberal and progressive sentiments may be split between the PPP and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), and its incarcerated leader, Imran Khan. The electoral showdown in the Punjab may be fierce, among all major parties, but between the PML-N and the PTI in particular. The northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province and the (former) Federally Administered Tribal Areas adjoining the Afghan border are being forecast as a sure win for PTI-aligned independent candidates. It would be intriguing if the PPP were compelled to join the PTI on the opposition benches, if the PML-N somehow manages to form alliances with smaller parties to cobble together its own government. How the religio-political right will do, under the banner of the rightist Jamaat-e-Islami and the aggressive Barelvi movement-affiliated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Labaik, also remains to be seen. All in all, as elections are now just around the corner, all we know for sure is that no matter what the exact outcome, the military will remain a key power broker, exerting even more influence on the country\u2019s foreign policies, on its economy, and on security policies at home. A year after devastating earthquakes, Turkey\u2019s recovery lags, but Erdo\u011fan suffers few political costs Howard Eissenstat Non-Resident Scholar The devastating February 2023 earthquake sharply focused attention on the cronyism and corruption that have helped fuel Turkey\u2019s domestic construction sector and, with it, much of the economic growth that is so central to the ruling party\u2019s political brand. But President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his governing coalition have yet to face a political reckoning because the authorities were able to shape the narrative around the disaster, silence criticism, shift blame to a handful of construction contractors, and connect disaster relief to electoral clientelism; thus, the ruling party looks set to win big in the upcoming municipal elections. This week marks the one-year anniversary of the Feb. 6, 2023, earthquakes that devastated Turkey and Syria, killing more than 52,000 people and destroying millions of buildings. As in any major disaster, the weaknesses of the system were laid bare. In Syria, the response to the earthquake highlighted the near total lack of state structures in the northern parts of the country. In Turkey, the earthquake sharply focused attention on the cronyism and corruption that have helped fuel the domestic construction sector and, with it, much of the economic growth so central to the ruling Justice and Development Party\u2019s (AKP) political brand. For those directly affected, of course, the pain of last year\u2019s earthquakes lingers. Whole families were wiped out, and more than a thousand children were orphaned. Millions were scarred, either physically or from psychological trauma; a recent study suggested that more than half of Turkish survivors suffer from some level of post-traumatic stress. According to Save the Children , \u201c[About] 2.4 million people, including 660,000 children, were forced from their homes into temporary settlements\u2026 One year on, over 761,000 people, including 205,000 children, are yet to return home.\u201d The international aid group adds, \u201cWhile Turkish authorities are trying to move people to formal housing areas, almost half (355,000) of those displaced are in informal, unregulated sites, often made up of small tents or containers made of plastic and metal, some as small as 3x7 metres [approximately 10 by 23 feet].\u201d Despite the mixed success of Turkey\u2019s rebuilding efforts, it is not at all clear that President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan or his ruling coalition have faced serious political blowback from the governmental response or from the corruption and mismanagement that so profoundly exacerbated the disaster in the first place. There are at least four reasons for this. First, the authorities were successful in framing the earthquake as something so large that no government could respond effectively, describing it repeatedly as \u201cthe disaster of the century.\u201d Second, and relatedly, the Erdo\u011fan government leveraged its control over almost all broadcast media in Turkey to show itself in a favorable light (relatedly, it also arrested some for sharing negative social media posts about its response). Third, officials shifted blame for lax oversight and cozy deals between bureaucrats and construction firms by targeting a handful of contractors for shoddy construction . Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, Erdo\u011fan made the case that voting for his coalition would help ensure aid, whereas voting for the opposition would risk it. As Turkey approaches municipal elections, scheduled for March of this year, Erdo\u011fan has doubled down on this \u201ccall to clientelism,\u201d telling voters in Hatay that they could only ensure support by voting for the governmental coalition. Opposition supporters have recently been quoted saying their chances of holding onto the traditional Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP) stronghold are \u201cslim.\u201d The devastation of last year\u2019s earthquake continues to echo today, and hundreds of thousands still have no permanent home. The Turkish economy still struggles with high inflation and the recent resignation of Hafize Gaye Erkan, the fifth head of Turkey\u2019s central bank to leave the post in the past five years, is unlikely to boost investor confidence. As Turkey enters municipal elections season next month, however, there are few signs that Erdo\u011fan has much reason for concern. EU steps up to Houthi maritime threat, but Operation Aspides may not be a game changer Emiliano Alessandri Non-Resident Scholar While the otherwise militarily modest EU has a solid track record when it comes to maritime operations, the combined military and political deterrent of its proposed Red Sea security initiative is likely to be small overall. Operation Aspides will remain a relatively minor factor in a much larger and more complex security equation that will not be solved until there is a political breakthrough around the war in Gaza. The European Union\u2019s soon-to-be launched Red Sea naval mission \u201cAspides\u201d is, at face value, a very sensible initiative to confront the growing threat posed by sea-based attacks carried out by the Houthi militia in Yemen. EU trade critically depends on freedom of navigation through the Bab el-Mandab Strait, a crucial artery accounting for around 12% of global seaborn trade \u2014 a percentage that doubles when it comes to goods and commodities to and from the European continent. And if there is one field in which the otherwise militarily modest EU has showed its teeth in recent decades it is precisely Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) maritime operations. The counter-piracy Operation Atalanta, off the coast of Somalia (ongoing since 2008), and the anti-trafficking Operation Sophia, in the Mediterranean Sea (replaced in 2020 by the narrower Operation Irini), offer a solid track record. Yet, as justified as it may be, Operation Aspides will hardly provide commercial ships attempting to reach the Mediterranean Sea via the Red Sea and the Suez Canal the effective \u201cshield\u201d its Ancient Greek name suggests. Set to be deployed later this month, pending its likely authorization by the EU\u2019s 27 members, the new mission will probably be only a few warships strong at the outset. More crucially, its mandate will be strictly confined to patrolling the area and, in the case of hostile acts, protecting cargo ships at sea. Unlike the US-led Operation Prosperity Guardian, Aspides will not engage the Houthi militia on land and will be strictly defensive in nature. Worryingly, the EU may not yet have a fully worked out plan about how exactly to respond if the naval mission itself \u2014 rather than commercial ships \u2014 were to come under attack. Is Europe ready for casualties and the need to retaliate and possibly even escalate if deterrence fails? While France and Germany are fully invested in the mission and an Italian admiral is set to take its tactical command (around 40% of Italy\u2019s sea-based trade goes through the Suez, and losses are already in the billions of euros), the combined military and political deterrent of the otherwise praiseworthy EU initiative is likely to be small overall. The ongoing US-UK airstrike campaign has for now done little to dissuade \u2014 or even significantly restrain \u2014 the Houthis, who seem determined to carry on their attacks against international vessels coasting Yemen until the war in Gaza ends. What is more, a number of shipping companies, starting with some of the big ones, have already opted for the much longer route around the African continent. It is unlikely they will reverse their policy any time soon, especially as the risk of regional military escalation has never been higher since the start of the Israel-Hamas war last October. While it will hopefully have some mitigating impact on war risk premiums, which have soared since last year, the operation is unlikely to be a game changer. Operation Aspides will remain a relatively minor factor in a much larger and more complex security equation that will not be solved until there is a political breakthrough around the war in Gaza. As the EU pushes its recently unveiled 10-point peace plan , Operation Aspides nonetheless sends a strong signal that Europe is ready to do its part when it comes to confronting Iran-backed proxies. It is also a reminder that any further delay in coupling Israel\u2019s anti-Hamas campaign with a resumption of the Middle East diplomatic process comes at a growing price for Europe.

Op-ed. Caroline Glick Feb 6, 2024, 12:43 AM (GMT+2) Caroline Glick Biden administration 24 minutes Caroline Glick Israel National News Caroline B. Glick is the senior contributing editor of Jewish News Syndicate and host of the \u201cCaroline Glick Show\u201d on JNS. She is also the diplomatic commentator for Israel\u2019s Channel 14, as well as a columnist for Newsweek. Glick is the senior fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at the Center for Security Policy in Washington and a lecturer at Israel\u2019s College of Statesmanship. (JNS) The Mothers of IDF Soldiers group led a demonstration last week of army mothers, reservists in the Israel Defense Forces, bereaved families and other concerned citizens outside the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. They demanded that President Joe Biden stop leveraging power to force Israel to resupply Hamas. The following day, hundreds of Israelis, including parents of soldiers, families of hostages and terror victims gathered outside Ashdod Port. For hours, they blocked trucks laden with supplies for Gaza from exiting the port. Activists have been blocking trucks from entering Gaza via the Kerem Shalom and Nitzana border crossings for more than two weeks. Speaking to the crowd in the southern Israeli city of Ashdod, Shifra Shahar, who runs a nonprofit organization that cares for the needs of soldiers, addressed her remarks to Israel\u2019s leaders: \u201cGovernment of Israel, defense minister, IDF chief of staff, get ahold of yourselves! \u201cNo other nation feeds and sustains its enemy! It\u2019s truly an Israeli start-up. \u201cWe had elections last year. I don\u2019t recall voting for [U.S. Secretary of State Antony] Blinken! Blinken is sitting in the war cabinet and protecting the interests of my enemy. \u2026 We have sons in Gaza. We have sons fighting. The entry of the trucks endangers them, prolongs the war, increases the number of casualties and delays the return of the hostages! \u201cThey tell me, \u2018There are constraints.\u2019 He who is constrained doesn\u2019t win the war. \u201cThey tell me, \u2018The Americans are threatening not to provide us with ammunition.\u2019 \u201cTo this, I say, if we were besieging them, we wouldn\u2019t need ammunition! The war would end. They\u2019d be screaming for help, returning the hostages and the war would end!\u201d The rising expressions of rage at the Biden administration from ordinary citizens are a testament to the shock and anger Israelis feel at what they perceive as a betrayal of Israel\u2019s most basic interests by Biden and his top advisers. Three and a half months ago, when Biden came to Israel, most Israelis couldn\u2019t imagine his warm embrace would transform into a torrent of hostile actions. At the height of Biden\u2019s emotional visit, he gave a speech to the people of Israel: \u201cI come to Israel with a single message. You are not alone. You are not alone. As long as the United States stands\u2014and we will stand forever\u2014we will not let you ever be alone.\u201d For the overwhelming majority of Israelis, Biden\u2019s declaration sounded like a bankable guarantee. But for the few with more sensitive ears, it sounded like a threat\u2014that he and his administration would never leave Israel alone to fight the war to victory. As the weeks and months passed, it turned out that the latter had it right. The administration has never let Israel alone to win the war whose outcome will determine whether the Jewish state can long survive. At every turn, in every quarter, the United States is constraining, undermining, subverting and coercing Israel to make moves that, as Shahar said, are \u201cagainst the interests of the citizens of Israe l.\u201d Ceasefire agreement The details of the hostages-for-terrorists-and-ceasefire talks that CIA director William Burns has been overseeing appear to involve Israel releasing from its prisons to Judea, Samaria and Gaza hundreds or perhaps thousands of Palestinian Arab terrorists, including mass murderers. The initial reports asserted that the terms for the deal were 100-250 terrorists for each of the 136 hostages. These terrorists can be expected to ignite Judea and Samaria and Israel\u2019s major cities in a terror conflagration that would make the Oct. 7 slaughter look like a walk in the park. Terrorists released to Gaza can be expected to rebuild Hamas\u2019s terror empire in the area. The released terrorists and their comrades on the ground will be able to do these things because, in addition to requiring Israel to free them in exchange for at least some of the 136 Israeli hostages Hamas has been holding since Oct. 7, Burns\u2019s deal requires Israel to end its military operations in Gaza for between one to two months. Based on interviews with Egyptian and Qatari officials involved in the hostage talks, both The Wall Street Journal and Qatari media have reported that the United States is telling Hamas through Egypt and Qatar that the deal is a trap for Israel. By compelling Israel to end its operations in Gaza for such a long period, Burns expects that the Netanyahu government will be unable to reinstate Israel\u2019s operations when the hostages-for-terrorists swap is concluded. The United States is intent on reaching a ceasefire because the Biden administration remains committed to its strategic objective of appeasing Iran at Israel\u2019s expense. Over the past several days, the U.S. media has reported claims by U.S. intelligence officials asserting that Iran is not responsible for the war being waged by its proxies Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Iranian-controlled Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria. U.S. intelligence officials insist these terror armies are attacking the United States and Israel because Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza. If Israel were to stop fighting, all the troubles would end. From an Israeli perspective, the prospect of ending the war without dismantling Hamas is an unacceptable outcome. If Hamas is able to survive after conducting its one-day Holocaust in southern Israel, not only will Hamas be able to proclaim victory but Iran and its terror proxies surrounding Israel will be emboldened to strike Israel even more aggressively on multiple fronts. Humanitarian Aid Humanitarian aid trucks passing into Gaza Flash 90 On Jan. 23, Shin Bet director Ronen Bar informed Israel\u2019s security cabinet that 60% to 70% of the so-called humanitarian aid entering Gaza daily either goes directly into Hamas\u2019s hands or is commandeered by Hamas terrorists for their use. Bar\u2019s admission bolstered eyewitness testimonies by Palestinian Arabs claiming that Hamas seized the aid trucks and footage from the Egyptian border with Gaza showing Hamas terrorists shooting at civilians seeking access to the supplies. Under such circumstances, it is clear that the Biden administration\u2019s pointed and ever-escalating demands that Israel permit more or less unlimited entry of supply-laden trucks to Gaza amounts to a demand that Israel resupply its enemy in the midst of war. As Shahar said, the constant supply of food, water, and, most critically, fuel to Hamas has enabled the terror group to maintain its presence in its underground warren of terror tunnels and continue to hold the Israeli hostages. The resupply also endangers Israel\u2019s soldiers, who are forced to fight inside tunnels where Hamas has a tactical advantage. From a strategic perspective, requiring Israel to resupply Hamas enables Hamas to retain its governing control over Gaza. So long as Hamas controls the supplies entering Gaza, it controls the distribution of those supplies. This compels the population to remain beholden to Hamas and not work with Israel to end the war by turning in Hamas terrorists or helping IDF forces locate and rescue the hostages. Egyptian Border The only way to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza without assisting Hamas is to provide them with the same right afforded to those in war zones worldwide: The right to leave the war zone for third countries. From the outset of the war, the Biden administration has strongly opposed Israel\u2019s efforts to persuade the Egyptian government to permit the people of Gaza to leave the area through the Rafah border crossing. In a speech last month in Tel Aviv, Secretary of State Antony Blinken reasserted U.S. opposition to permitting Gazans to leave the area. \u201cThe United States unequivocally rejects any proposals advocating for the resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza,\u201d he exhorted. It isn\u2019t that the Gazans have nowhere to go. Since Oct. 7, multiple countries, including Chechnya, Turkey, Scotland and Canada have stated their willingness to permit Gazans to seek refuge in their countries. Qatar, which serves as Hamas\u2019s state sponsor, is another option. Rafah is a short drive from El Arish International Airport, where these refugees would be able to fly to third countries. Gazans wait to cross into Egypt through Rafah border crossing Abed Rahim Khatib/Flash 90 According to Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper, Gazans are currently forced to pay $10,000 in bribes to Egyptian border guards to cross into Egypt for refuge. Moreover, as of Feb. 4, the IDF assesses that Hamas has changed its tactics. Rather than fight IDF forces primarily from tunnels, Hamas is increasingly attacking Israeli units in Gaza and bombing Israel with rockets from within humanitarian safe zones where hundreds of thousands of Gazans are now sheltering. Given the circumstances, the U.S. position requires Israel to choose between defeating Hamas at a profound cost to civilian lives or being defeated itself. Weapons Supply On Jan. 28, NBC News reported that the administration is considering slowing supplies of various weapons, including 155 mm artillery rounds and joint direct attack munitions (JDAMs) to Israel to compel Israel to scale back its ground operations in Gaza and permit more supplies to enter the area. Although the White House denied the reports, the IDF has been compelled to conserve its ammunition on the ground due to shortages in supplies, indicating that the United States is slow-walking its supply of key armaments to Israel. This is of major concern, particularly given the near certainty of escalation along the northern front, where Hezbollah-controlled Lebanon is moving quickly towards a full-scale war with Israel. Palestinian Arab Statehood For Israelis, Oct. 7 was an illusion-shattering event. One of the primary illusions shattered was the two-state paradigm. Hamas, which won the 2006 Palestinian elections\u2014the last elections held by the rival Fatah faction\u2019s Palestinian Authority\u2014has maintained the support of the majority of Palestinian Arabs in Gaza and Judea and Samaria throughout the intervening years. On Oct. 7, it was Hamas that initiated and led the slaughter of 1,200 Israelis, but thousands of Gaza civilians followed them into Israel and were full participants in the atrocities; including murder, rape, torture, kidnapping and looting. Avida Bachar survived the massacre at Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, which saw Palestinian Arabs murder 130 people, including his wife and son, who were murdered next to Bachar and his daughter in the family\u2019s safe room. Crews who recovered the bodies of the victims in Be\u2019eri reported that 80% of the bodies showed signs of torture. Be\u2019eri is a kibbutz identified with the secular far-left. Its members included prominent peace activists. The surviving members have been forced to come to terms with the atrocities they suffered. In an interview last month with Israel\u2019s Channel 14 , Bachar explained, \u201cWe need to ask if we are capable of coexisting there. The 7th of October showed that the level of evil there means that coexistence is apparently impossible. We can\u2019t do it anymore. Because we gave them everything. They even worked in our community. And in the end, we were proven wrong. \u2026 We reached the point where their children burned us alive in our shelters. The older ones shot us through the doors. And anyone who tried to jump out the window\u2014they shot him again. Their elderly, on wheelchairs, and their handicapped arrived at Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, and they looted us and kidnapped us as hostages. We need to understand this situation. And when a person has infinite demands at negotiations, apparently, either we won\u2019t be here or they won\u2019t be here. We mustn\u2019t leave. Home on kibbutz Be'eri after massacre Edi Israel / Flash 90 The overwhelming majority of Israelis agree with Bachar. Polls taken since Oct. 7 show that three-quarters of Israelis oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state. 70% of Israelis who voted for opposition parties, which include parties on the center and far-left, the Arab nationalist party and the Islamist party, believe that there is no chance of peaceful coexistence with the Palestinian Arabs. This position places the Israeli people, rather than simply the government, at odds with the Biden administration, which since the outset of the war has insisted that its strategic goal is to establish a Palestinian state in Gaza and Judea and Samaria under the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. The P.A., for its part, not only refuses to condemn the Oct. 7 slaughter but seeks to form a unity government with Hamas. Fatah forces in Gaza participated alongside Hamas terrorists in the slaughter of Oct. 7 and posted videos of themselves killing Israelis on their Telegram pages. Biden and his advisers state regularly that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian Arabs. But the Palestinian Arabs disagree wholeheartedly. According to their own pollsters, 75% of Palestinian Arabs support Hamas. Last week, it was reported that the State Department is considering unilateral U.S. recognition of a \u201cState of Palestine.\u201d Such a move would not merely be an act of hostility against Israel. It would constitute a material breach of the Oslo Accords, of which the U.S. is a signatory. The agreements signed in the 1990s by Israel and the Palestinian Arabs under U.S. aegis barred the Palestinian Arabs from unilaterally forming a state or using the international arena as a means to settle the Palestinian Arab conflict with Israel. Under the Oslo Accords, all agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs must be reached through bilateral negotiations. Foreign Workers As Bachar noted, among the participants in the Oct. 7 slaughter were workers who had been employed by the assaulted kibbutzim, in some cases for decades. Those workers provided precise intelligence on the kibbutzim down to the number of people per household, the location of communal weapons stores, and the homes of soldiers and security forces, among other things. Polling of Palestinian Arabs in Gaza and Judea and Samaria found that more than 80% of the Palestinian Arabs support the massacres of Oct. 7. Due to the massive levels of public support for the massacres, and the service Palestinian Arab workers provided Hamas as intelligence gatherers, the Israeli government passed a decision barring Palestinian Arabs from working in Israel. To replace them, the government decided to permit foreign workers from friendly countries, including India, to enter Israel on work permits. Economy Minister Nir Barkat finalized an agreement on the entry of Indian workers with his Indian counterpart. Last week, the Israeli media reported that the Biden administration has intervened to block the replacement of Palestinian Arab workers with Indian and other foreign workers. According to a report in Israel\u2019s Calcalist , Cindy Dyer, the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons wrote a letter to her Israeli counterpart and the Justice Ministry insisting that the use of manpower companies to import foreign workers risks breaching bans on human trafficking and exploitation, and demanded that Israel not import laborers through manpower companies. Since these companies are the primary means to bring in foreign laborers, the impact of the State Department intervention has been to place an insurmountable obstacle in Israel\u2019s path to replacing Palestinian Arab workers who overwhelmingly support the genocide of the Jews of Israel. Sanctioning Israeli Residents of Judea and Samaria According to Israel police data from the Samaria and Judea District, in 2023 Palestinian Arabs carried out 5,600 terrorist attacks against Israelis. During the same period, Israelis carried out 60 acts of violence against Palestinian Arabs. IDF data indicates that violent incidents involving Israelis and Palestinian Arabs in October 2023 were down 31% from the same month in 2022 and violent incidents involving Israelis and Palestinian Arabs were down 55% in November 2023 from the previous November. All the same, last Thursday, President Biden issued an Executive Order that imposes sweeping economic sanctions on Israelis deemed by the secretary of state or secretary of treasury to be engaging in so-called \u201csettler violence.\u201d The sanctions, which obviously represent a flagrant violation of Israeli sovereignty and an expression of utter contempt for Israel\u2019s criminal justice system, not only freeze the assets of those accused of acting in a prohibited manner. It bars anyone from having any economic transactions with those sanctioned individuals. The Executive Order was issued against four Israeli citizens who have not been accused or convicted of any felonies. The determination of who to sanction appears to be informed entirely by unsubstantiated allegations presented by Palestinian advocacy groups that do not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist. All the same, fearful of U.S. sanctions, Bank Leumi and Israel\u2019s postal bank informed two of the sanctioned individuals that they had frozen their bank accounts. Visiting Yinon Levy, a rancher whose accounts in Bank Leumi were frozen on Sunday, MK Zvi Succot said, \u201cThere is no evidence to the allegations, there is no indictment, criminal record or a record with the Shin Bet. All it is is that leftists don\u2019t like that Jews are building a farm.\u201d Commentator Stephen Leavitt put it succinctly: \u201cBiden cancelled sanctions against Iran and shifted them over to Israel.\u201d It is worth noting that the Biden administration has placed no comparable sanctions on either Palestinian Arab individuals who engage in actual acts of terrorism against Israelis or on the P.A., which incites, finances and sponsors terrorist attacks against Israel. It has not placed sanctions on the P.A.\u2019s security services whose members have routinely engaged in terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. To the contrary, the administration stopped enforcing the 2018 Taylor Force Act, which bars the United States from funding the P.A. so long as it maintains its \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d policy of paying salaries and annuities to imprisoned terrorists and the families of dead terrorists. This Jews-only Executive Order works to turn sanctioned Israeli Jews who live in Judea and Samaria into pariahs in their own communities and to criminalize the half-million Israeli Jews who live in Judea and Samaria. But it does something much bigger as well: It advances the slander that Israelis are the moral equivalent of Hamas terrorists and the civilian lynch mobs that accompany them in their slaughter of Israeli Jews. Application of Leahy Law Against IDF in Judea and Samaria The week after the Oct. 7 atrocities, ahead of Friday prayers, the P.A.\u2019s Religious Affairs Ministry distributed guidance to P.A.-controlled mosques throughout Judea and Samaria calling for worshippers to attack Israeli communities. Last week, the IDF killed four Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists in Jenin who were planning just such an operation. Their planned attack was one of many the IDF has prevented at the last moment since Oct 7. Since the Hamas-led invasion of southern Israel, IDF units in Judea and Samaria have killed more than 500 terrorists and arrested thousands more. And they are just a drop in the bucket. The number of active terror cells continues to grow. Despite the acute danger this terror nexus poses to the lives of the 500,000 Israelis who live in the areas and millions more in Jerusalem and central Israel, the Biden administration is acting to intimidate Israel into ending its counterterror operations in Judea and Samaria. This week, the Israeli media reported that the State Department has begun investigating IDF units operating in Judea and Samaria for possible violations of the Leahy Law. The Leahy Law requires militaries receiving U.S. military aid to abide by the same human-rights standard that the U.S. military applies in its operations. The constant allegation made by U.S. officials, spurred by members of the so-called progressive \u201cSquad\u201d of progressive, anti-Israel lawmakers in Congress, is that IDF operations in Gaza are inherently suspect. According to the reports, the State Department sent a letter to the Foreign Ministry a month ago threatening to deny military equipment to several individual units operating in Judea and Samaria. Israel has two months to submit its response to the State Department\u2019s accusations. The underlying assumption at the base of the accusations is even more dire than the allegations themselves. The United States demands that Israel account for every operation posits that Israel\u2019s presence in Judea and Samaria is inherently illegitimate, and that so are its counterterror operations in the areas. This view, which accords with the administration\u2019s demand that no Palestinian Arab leave Gaza and that Israel seize no buffer zones in Gaza to protect the Western Negev, stands at the base of the administration\u2019s refusal to reconsider the strategic logic, viability and morality of its demand that Israel support the formation of a Palestinian state in its heartland, whose leaders and citizens are unified in their commitment to Israel\u2019s annihilation. Practically speaking, Washington\u2019s wielding of the Leahy Law against IDF units in Judea and Samaria intimidates IDF commanders, who now need to be concerned that they will be sanctioned for their efforts to defend their country and its citizens against Israel\u2019s enemies. Undermining Israel\u2019s Political Stability Speaking last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Blinken insisted that the key to peace in the Middle East is the establishment of a Palestinian state. Despite the fact that Palestinian Arabs are near-universal in their desire to annihilate Israel and their rejection of the U.S. goal of a two-state solution that would see the formation of a Palestinian Arab state living in peace with the Jewish state of Israel, Blinken insisted that \u201cArab leaders, Palestinian leaders\u201d have prepared their people for Palestinian statehood. \u201cI think the challenge now, the question now is: Is Israeli society prepared to engage in these questions? Is it prepared to have that mindset?\u201d Israelis, of course, have engaged in the question of Palestinian Arb statehood. After the atrocities that the Palestinian Arabs carried out on Oct. 7\u2014and the full mobilization of Palestinian Arab society in Gaza, and Judea and Samaria, on behalf of Hamas\u2019s war of genocide\u2014Israelis recognized that there was no prospect for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinian Arabs. As Direct Polls revealed last month, 81% of Israelis, including Arab Israelis, say there is no prospect for peace with the Palestinian Arabs. A whopping 88% of Israelis do not trust the Palestinian leadership. Blinken, however, has no interest in Israeli public sentiment. He places the blame for Israel\u2019s unwillingness to accept a Palestinian terror state in its heartland not on the genocidal nature of Palestinian Arab society, but on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Since Netanyahu opposes the transfer of Gaza to the Hamas-supporting P.A. in any postwar scenario and opposes Palestinian sovereignty, Blinken, the president and the administration as a whole are keen to see Netanyahu ousted from power. On Jan. 7, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper reported that an administration official told him that Netanyahu has to choose between his coalition partners from the nationalist Religious Zionism and Jewish Power parties led by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, respectively, and his ties to President Biden and the United States. This leak is simply a restatement of Biden\u2019s remarks to Jewish donors on Dec. 12, in which he excoriated Ben-Gvir for his opposition to Palestinian Arab statehood and implied that Netanyahu needs to choose between Ben-Gvir and likeminded ministers in his government and U.S. support for Israel. A week after Tapper\u2019s report, NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell reported that, in light of Netanyahu\u2019s rejection of the administration\u2019s efforts to end the war with a Palestinian state, \u201cThree senior U.S. officials say the Biden administration is looking past Netanyahu to try to achieve its goals in the region.\u201d Mitchell wrote, \u201cThe Biden administration is trying to lay the groundwork with other Israeli and civil society leaders in anticipation of an eventual post-Netanyahu government. In an attempt to work around Netanyahu, [during his visit to Israel] Blinken also met individually with members of his war Cabinet and other Israeli leaders, including opposition leader \u2026 Yair Lapid.\u201d Forcing Netanyahu to choose between his governing coalition and ties with the United States is a recipe for political chaos and military defeat. If Netanyahu betrays his coalition partners and accepts the U.S. demand for appeasement and defeat in war, then his government will fall and Israel will find itself in an unprecedented national security crisis at the height of a pre-election period of political turmoil and domestic rancor. Given the threat level, the administration\u2019s effort to dismantle Israel\u2019s government endangers Israel\u2019s very existence. Lebanon This week, presidential envoy and U.S. interlocutor with Hezbollah-controlled Lebanon Amos Hochstein arrived in Israel in yet another bid to prevent Israel from removing Hezbollah forces and missiles from Southern Lebanon, where they pose an existential threat to Israel through military means. For the past four months, Hochstein has been seeking to force Israel to accept a \u201cdiplomatic solution\u201d to Hezbollah\u2019s military threat. Hezbollah, with its tens of thousands of battle-hardened terrorists perched along Lebanon\u2019s border with Israel and its arsenal of 150,000 missiles, rockets, drones and mortars poses such a clear and urgent threat to Israel that immediately after Hezbollah began shelling northern Israel without provocation on Oct. 8, the government rightly removed 80,000 Israeli residents from border communities in the north. They have been living in hotels ever since. Israel demands that Hezbollah abide by the terms of the ceasefire set out in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 at the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon War. 1701 requires Hezbollah forces and missiles to be located north of the Litani River, 30 km north of the border with Israel. Rather than join Israel in insisting on Hezbollah compliance with the U.S.-sponsored resolution, Hochstein is offering Israel an unenforceable deal that would see Hezbollah remove its forces to just a handful of kilometers north of the border. In its latest iteration, Hochstein\u2019s \u201cdeal\u201d would be implemented in two stages. In the first stage, Hezbollah would move its forces 8-12 km from the border and be replaced by UNIFIL forces and the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF). Israeli residents of the border communities would then return to their homes. In the second phase, Israel would agree to discuss the surrender of its sovereign territory along the border with Lebanon to Hezbollah-controlled Lebanon. The areas under discussion include strategic points from Rosh Hanikra on the coastline in the west to Mt. Dov along the Syrian border in the east. There are three fundamental problems with the deal the U.S. is demanding that Israel accept. First, the LAF is completely beholden to and operates in the service of Hezbollah. UNIFIL does nothing without Hezbollah\u2019s permission. This is the reason Hezbollah has been able to operate in complete breach of Resolution 1701 since 2006. As a consequence, it is absurd to believe that they would be in a position to enforce the agreement or would have any interest in doing so. Given the weakness and complicity of UNIFIL and the LAF, the only party capable of enforcing the deal is the IDF. And the U.S. offer precludes an Israeli military operation or presence in Southern Lebanon. Since the proposal cannot be enforced under its terms, the 80,000 Israeli refugees from the border communities will not be able to return home with even a modicum of safety. Second, Hezbollah\u2019s territorial demands are completely frivolous. The areas in dispute were never Lebanese territory. The administration\u2019s adamant insistence that Israel concede to Hezbollah\u2019s demands for its sovereign territory, including Mount Dov, which controls all of northern Israel, is a hostile position. Israel cannot accept it. Finally, just as the administration\u2019s positions vis-\u00e0-vis Gaza foresee and indeed require Israel to accept defeat in war, so its \u201cdiplomatic solution\u201d for Lebanon requires Israel to accept strategic defeat at the hands of Iran\u2019s Lebanese proxy Hezbollah. Iran Since Oct. 7, the Biden administration has been insisting that it has no evidence that Iran had prior knowledge of Hamas\u2019s attack. As Iran\u2019s other regional proxies\u2014Hezbollah, the Houthis, the Iranian-controlled Shi\u2019ite militia in Iraq\u2014have joined the war against Israel and the U.S., the Biden administration has maintained its stubborn refusal to acknowledge that Iran is the head of the snake. But facts are stubborn things. Iran controls all of its proxies. Ahead of Oct. 7, Hamas terrorists received training for their mission of slaughter in Iran and Lebanon. In the months before the Oct. 7 invasion, Hamas terror-masters met in Beirut at least twice with Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leaders and their Hezbollah counterparts. Iran funds, arms and trains all of its proxies. An Iranian spy ship in the Red Sea is directing all the Houthi missile and drone attacks against Israel and commercial shipping in the Red Sea. While directing its proxies\u2019 operations, Iran itself is sprinting towards the entrance to the nuclear club. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has massively expanded its near-bomb-grade-level uranium enrichment and has effectively become a threshold nuclear state. These realities present Israel with an unacceptable threat environment that it must counter militarily or risk its physical destruction. For the Biden administration, these realities present an opportunity to force Israel to agree to lose in Gaza and Lebanon and establish a Palestinian state or lose U.S. support and be compelled to stand up to Iran and all of its proxies on its own with insufficient weapons and no diplomatic backing from Washington. Addressing his government at its weekly meeting Sunday, Netanyahu noted the discord with the Biden administration. \u201cIsrael is a sovereign state,\u201d he began. \u201cWe greatly appreciate the support that we have received from the Biden administration since the outbreak of the war: In weaponry, at international institutions, in sending forces to the region and more. This is not to say that there are no disagreements among us but as of today we have succeeded in overcoming them with determined and balanced decisions.\u201d He went on, \u201cAs a sovereign state that is fighting for its existence and its future, we make our own decisions; even in those instances where there is no agreement with our American friends.\u201d Seemingly with each passing day, the Biden administration announces a new initiative aimed at undermining Israel\u2019s ability to defend itself, either by limiting its military options, constraining its diplomatic maneuvering room, empowering its enemies or inducing domestic discord and social cleavages. At a certain point in the not-so-distant future, Netanyahu will need to say \u201cno\u201d to the administration. It can only be hoped that the vast majority of Americans, who stand with Israel against its enemies, will stand with Israel when we arrive at that point. Found a mistake?

The military continued to strike targets in areas of the besieged territory where it has told civilians to seek refuge. There was meanwhile no word on whether medicines that entered the territory Wednesday as part of a deal brokered by France and Qatar had been distributed to dozens hostages with chronic illnesses who are being held by Hamas. \ud83d\udea8 Breaking: Assisted by @UNRWA , Hamas terrorists again take control of aid trucks today before they reach civilians \ud83d\udc47 Civilians in Gaza are starving despite hundreds of aid trucks entering every day. Meanwhile most Hamas terrorists are obese. pic.twitter.com/YKUcCWFxuY \u2014 Dr. Eli David (@DrEliDavid) January 6, 2024 More than 100 days after Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack, Israel continues to wage one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history, with the goal of dismantling the militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007 and returning scores of captives. The war has stoked tensions across the region, threatening to ignite other conflicts. More than 24,000 Palestinians have been killed, some 85% of the narrow coastal territory\u2019s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, and the United Nations says a quarter of the population is starving. Hundreds of thousands have heeded Israeli evacuation orders and packed into southern Gaza, where shelters run by the United Nations are overflowing and massive tent camps have gone up. But Israel has continued to strike what it says are militant targets in all parts of Gaza, often killing women and children. Dr. Talat Barhoum at Rafah\u2019s el-Najjar Hospital confirmed the death toll from the strike in Rafah and said dozens more were wounded. Associated Press footage from the hospital showed relatives weeping over the bodies of loved ones. \u201cThey were suffering from hunger, they were dying from hunger, and now they have also been hit,\u201d said Mahmoud Qassim, a relative of some of those who were killed. Internet and mobile services in Gaza have been down for five days, the longest of several outages during the war, according to internet access advocacy group NetBlocks. The outages complicate rescue efforts and make it difficult to obtain information about the latest strikes and casualties. The war has rippled across the Middle East, with Iran-backed groups attacking U.S. and Israeli targets. Low-intensity fighting between Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon threatens to erupt into all-out war, and Houthi rebels in Yemen continue to target international shipping despite United States-led airstrikes. Iran has launched a series of missile attacks targeting what it described as an Israeli spy base in Iraq and militant bases in Syria as well as in Pakistan, which carried out reprisal strikes against what it described as militant hideouts in Iran early Thursday. It was not clear if the strikes in Syria and Pakistan were related to the Gaza war. But they showcased Iran\u2019s ability to carry out long-range missile attacks at a time of heightened tensions with Israel and the U.S., which has provided crucial support for the Gaza offensive and carried out its own strikes against Iran-allied groups in Syria and Iraq. Israel has vowed to dismantle Hamas to ensure it can never repeat an attack like the one on Oct. 7. Militants burst through Israel\u2019s border defenses and stormed through several communities that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Israel has also vowed to return all the hostages remaining in captivity after more than 100 \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 were released during a November cease-fire in exchange for the release of scores of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Family members and supporters were marking the first birthday of Kfir Bibas, the youngest Israeli hostage, in a somber ceremony Thursday in Tel Aviv. The red-haired infant and his 4-year-old brother Ariel were captured along with their mother, Shiri, and their father, Yarden. All four remain in captivity. The agreement to ship in medicines was the first to be brokered between the warring sides since November. Hamas said that for every box of medicine bound for the hostages, 1,000 would be sent for Palestinian civilians, in addition to food and humanitarian aid. Qatar confirmed late Wednesday that the medicine had entered Gaza, but it was not yet clear if it had been distributed to the hostages, who are being held in secret locations, including underground bunkers. Hamas has continued to fight back across Gaza, even in the most devastated areas, and launch rockets into Israel. It says it will not release any more hostages until there is a permanent cease-fire, something Israel and the United States, its top ally, have ruled out. Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry says at least 24,448 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, with over 60,000 wounded. It says many other dead and wounded are trapped under rubble or unreachable because of the fighting. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and children. Israel blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it fights in dense residential areas. Israel says its forces have killed roughly 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and that 193 of its own soldiers have been killed since the Gaza ground offensive began.

Chen Goldstein-Almog, 48, was held hostage by Hamas with three of her children for 51 days following the Palestinian terrorist group\u2019s Oct. 7 attack on Israelis. Her husband and eldest daughter were murdered by Palestinian terrorists during the attack. CNN HOST CLASHES WITH PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT OVER HAMAS\u2019 USE OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE: \u2018YOU TURNED IT BACK TO ISRAEL\u2019 Chen Goldstein-Almog, 48, was held hostage with three of her children by Hamas for 51 days following the Palestinian terrorist group\u2019s Oct. 7 attack on innocent Israelis.\u00a0(Israel Defense Forces via AP) Goldstein-Almog and her children were released by the terror group, and the wife and mother gave an interview with the Israeli press on Dec. 11 about her time as a hostage. During her interview, Goldstein-Almog revealed she heard firsthand accounts of sexual violence from other female hostages by their Hamas captors. \u201cI heard the testimony directly from girls and heard things second hand,\u201d Goldstein-Almog said. \u201cSome of the sexual violence happened well into our time in Gaza, not in the first week.\u201d \u201cBut the way their bodies were desecrated, they don\u2019t know how they will deal with that. It happened weeks into their time in Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were released earlier, they would\u2019ve been saved from experiencing sexual violence,\u201d Goldstein-Almog added. Goldstein-Almog said they \u201cheard three stories firsthand of women saying they were sexually abused and we heard an additional story.\u201d She added that \u201cpresumably, there are more instances\u201d of sexual violence by Hamas. Briahna Joy Gray, a former spokesperson for Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, tweeted, \u201c\u2018Believe all women\u2019 was always an absurd overreach: woman should be heard, claims should be investigated, but evidence is required.\u201d\u00a0(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) The former hostage also said she \u201cwas threatened once when they thought I was wandering around and looking free\u201d in the first apartment they were taken to and that \u201cthere was a threat that\u201d she would \u201cbe handcuffed, but it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d \u201cI said I have kids and nothing happened to me,\u201d Goldstein-Almog said. \u201cIt was the only time I felt under threat [of sexual violence].\u201d A spokesperson for the Biden administration State Department noted earlier this month that one of the reasons Hamas does not want to release women hostages is because \u201cthey don\u2019t want those women to be able to talk about what happened to them.\u201d Many American progressives have been largely silent on Hamas\u2019 sexual violence against Israelis, while some have downplayed or dismissed the reports of sexual assault.

Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was torched after she clashed with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash over the lack of widespread condemnation of Hamas\u2019 use of sexual violence against Israeli women during the Oct. 7 attacks. The Washington state Democrat suggested that wasn\u2019t true and claimed she had already condemned Hamas\u2019 treatment of women, before quickly turning the conversation back to Israel. \u201cBut I think we have to remember Israel is a democracy. That is why they\u2019re a strong ally of ours. And if they do not comply with international humanitarian law, they are bringing themselves to a place that makes it much more difficult strategically for them to be able to build allies, to keep public opinion with them, and frankly, morally, we cannot say that one war crime deserves another. That is not what international humanitarian law says,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cWith respect, I was just asking about the women, and you turned it back to Israel.

Fifteen thousand Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes, three-quarters of whom are women and children.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019s horrible,\u201d Bash said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t see Israeli soldiers raping Palestinian women.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be the hierarchies of oppressions,\u201d Jayapal said.

The announcement Thursday morning came minutes before the cease-fire was set to expire. Hamas released two Israeli women from captivity several hours later, Israel\u2019s military said. Israel had agreed to extend the truce by one day for every 10 militant-held hostages who are freed. The cease-fire, which began Nov. 24 and was originally set to expire on Monday, has paused the deadliest fighting between Israel and Palestinians in decades. Israel has vowed to resume the war in an effort to end Hamas\u2019 16-year rule of Gaza, but it\u2019s facing mounting international pressure to spare southern Gaza a devastating ground offensive like the one that has demolished much of the north. Roughly 240 hostages were captured by Hamas in its Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel that ignited the war. More than 13,300 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, according to the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in Gaza, which doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants. About 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the initial incursion by Hamas. \u2014 Truce in Israel-Hamas war is extended by a day, minutes before it was set to expire. \u2014 Jake Sullivan says the White House is not seeking conditions on military aid to Israel, despite Biden\u2019s comment. \u2014 Israel compares Hamas to the Islamic State group. But the comparison misses the mark in key ways. \u2014 U.S. Senate Majority Leader Schumer warns that antisemitism is on the rise as he pushes for Israel aid. \u2014 A friendship forged over 7 weeks of captivity lives on. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the war: The Israeli military said Thursday that two Israeli hostages were released from captivity in the Gaza Strip. In a statement, the army said the Red Cross had transferred the two women to Israeli forces. They were to be taken to an Israeli military base. The two hostages are among a larger group of Israelis expected to be released Thursday as part of the latest extension of a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Israel was to free some 30 Palestinian prisoners later Thursday. TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is reminding Israeli leaders of the need for Israel to comply with international law as it prosecutes its war against Hamas in Gaza. Blinken also said it is imperative that Israel take great care to avoid civilian casualties if it starts major military operations in southern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter after fleeing their homes in the northern part of the territory. He said the U.S. places great importance on the resumption of a peace process that would eventually lead to the creation of a Palestinian state, something that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes. Speaking Thursday just hours after Israel and Hamas agreed at the last minute to a third extension of their cease-fire agreement, Blinken told Netanyahu that the U.S. will continue \u201csupport for Israel\u2019s right to protect itself from terrorist violence in compliance with international humanitarian law and urged Israel to take every possible measure to avoid civilian harm,\u201d\u00a0the State Department said. The message aligned with the Biden administration\u2019s shifting rhetoric on the war, which began as a full-throated embrace of Israel\u2019s response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks but gradually tempered as the number of Palestinian civilian casualties began to rise, prompting widespread international criticism. To prevent a further exponential increase in civilian casualties, Blinken \u201cstressed the imperative of accounting for humanitarian and civilian protection needs in southern Gaza before any military operations there and urged immediate steps to hold settler extremists accountable for violence against Palestinians in the West Bank,\u201d the State Department said Blinken told Netanyahu. Blinken met with Netanyahu and his war Cabinet in Jerusalem before traveling to the occupied West Bank for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The Israeli army has confirmed that Ofir Tzarfati, an Israeli believed to be held hostage in Gaza, is dead. Tzarfati was thought to be among the approximately 240 people taken hostage by Hamas on October 7. He had been celebrating his 27th birthday at a music festival with his girlfriend when Hamas militants stormed into Israel and killed at least 364 people at the festival and kidnapped many others. Tzarfati\u2019s family was originally unclear what happened to him, but a few weeks later, the army notified the family that they believed that Tzarfati was being held in Gaza, according to media reports. The army did not specify where Tzarfati\u2019s body was identified TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 Two gunman opened fire on a crowded bus station at the entrance of Jerusalem, killing at least three people and wounding several others, according to Jerusalem police. Another blatant violation of the ceasefire. A terrorist attack, murdering people waiting for the bus. https://t.co/0Vtbse4CMB \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) November 30, 2023 \u201cThe bus station was very crowded, which is why so many people were wounded,\u201d\u00a0said Magen David Adom spokesperson Zaki Heller told Army Radio. According to police, the two gunmen drove toward the bus stop armed with a handgun and an M16 rifle and opened fire. Both were killed at the scene by two soldiers who were near the bus stop. Jerusalem police chief Doron Turgeman said police believe both attackers were from east Jerusalem. It was unclear if the attack was carried out by a Palestinian militant group or individuals acting on their own, or if it would have any impact on the truce in Gaza. One 24-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene and another man died later at the hospital. A year ago, a bomb exploded at the same bus stop, killing a 16-year-old boy and wounding 18. JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel and Hamas agreed to extend a temporary truce by another day just minutes before it was set to expire, said Qatar, which has been mediating between the two sides. The truce was set to expire Thursday morning. Negotiations on extending it came down to the wire, with last-minute disagreements over the hostages to be freed by Hamas in exchange for another day of a halt in fighting. The Qatari Foreign Ministry said the truce was being extended under the same terms as in the past, under which Hamas has released 10 Israeli hostages per day in exchange for 30 Palestinian prisoners. Israel released another group of Palestinian prisoners early Thursday in exchange for 16 hostages freed hours earlier by the Islamic militant group Hamas in Gaza. A bus carrying some of the Palestinian detainees arrived in the West Bank city of Ramallah before dawn. The releases came on the sixth day of a temporary truce in the Israel-Hamas war. Most prominent among those freed was 22-year-old Ahed Tamimi, an activist who gained worldwide fame in 2017 after a video of her slapping an Israeli soldier went viral on social media. Israeli troops arrested her at her West Bank home on Nov. 6 for \u201cinciting to terrorism\u201d\u00a0on her Instagram account. Her mother said Tamimi\u2019s account had been hacked.

Military officials said late Monday that the hostages were on Israeli soil and undergoing initial medical checks before being reunited with their families. It is the fourth such release under a cease-fire deal with the Hamas military group. Israel is to free 33 Palestinian prisoners later Monday. The cease-fire had been set to expire early Tuesday. But Qatar, which has been mediating between the sides, said they agreed to extend the truce by two more days. The war broke out Oct. 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 240 others captive. Israel declared war, and over 13,000 Palestinians have been killed in weeks of Israeli strikes, according to health authorities in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. Israeli media said the hostages included two women and nine children. Two of the children are 3 years old. The release of 11 Israeli hostages and 33 Palestinians under the original ceasefire agreement, which had been due to end Monday night, dominated the day\u2019s flurry of truce activity. According to a Reuters report,\u00a0\u00a0the Israeli hostages released from Gaza on Monday include three French citizens, two Germans and six Argentinians. The news service cited\u00a0a Qatari foreign ministry spokesman \u00a0on social media platform X. The White House said U.S. officials had hoped two American women would be among the latest group to be freed from Gaza, where it believes eight or nine U.S. citizens are being held. Hamas said it had received a list of Palestinians to be released from Israeli jails. It said these included three female prisoners and 30 minors. \u00a9 2023 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

The agency said the incident took place near the town of Tir Harfa, about a mile from the Israeli frontier. The strike came less than a day after Hezbollah hit Israeli Defense Forces\u2019\u00a0military positions near the border, according to reports. \u201cAccording to Israeli Media, Hezbollah has launched upwards of 40 Rockets and 3 Attack Drones against IDF Positions in Northern Israel this morning causing Significant Damage to at least 1 Military Outpost along the Border, with this being seen as a Serious Escalation,\u201d an open-source intelligence monitor posted Monday on X. Israeli aircraft Tuesday struck three-armed terror cells in Lebanese territory close to the border, as well as a number of Hezbollah targets, the army said, according to Jewish News Syndicate . Sirens sounded in northern Israel on Tuesday morning due to a potential hostile aircraft intrusion from Lebanon, with the IDF later giving the all-clear. Three anti-tank missile launches from Lebanon toward the area of Metula near the Israel-Lebanon border were identified by the IDF on Tuesday morning. No injuries were reported, and the IDF struck the source of the launches. Later on Tuesday morning, the IDF reported that terrorists fired mortar shells at a military post in northern Israel. Lebanon\u2019s Al Mayadeen TV, which the two killed reporters were working for, said Israel had carried out the attack and deliberately targeted the journalists. Israel\u2019s military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah broke out after Hezbollah\u2019s Palestinian ally Hamas launched an attack on Israel on Oct. 7. The border violence has escalated, raising Western fears of a widening war in the Middle East that could draw in both the United States and Iran. It is the worst violence at the border since Israel and Hezbollah fought a war in 2006 and has so far killed more than 70 Hezbollah fighters, 13 Lebanese civilians, seven Israeli troops and three Israeli civilians.

Intelligence and additional details related to the hostages being held by Hamas and efforts to bring them home were also discussed. The two leaders spoke on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and how to overcome the challenges in facilitating aid to the civilian population, as well as the international community\u2019s role in getting more urgent supplies delivered to the area. Gallant also expressed his appreciation for America\u2019s ongoing support and deep partnership, and the two agreed to remain in close contact. Fox News\u2019 Dana Karni contributed to this report. Posted by Elizabeth Pritchett Share 10 hour(s) ago Medical supplies provided by Israeli forces arrive at Gaza hospital Israel Defense Forces said medical supplies provided by the force have arrived at the al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. (Israel Defense Forces/X) The Israel Defense Forces said medical supplies, including baby food and incubators, have arrived at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza amid the targeted attack on Hamas terrorists inside the building. \u201cWe can now confirm that incubators, baby food and medical supplies, provided by the IDF, have successfully reached the hospital,\u201d the IDF wrote on X. The supplies arrived Wednesday morning after Israeli soldiers began a \u201cprecise and targeted operation\u201d against Hamas, which operates out of the hospital. The operation remains active, according to the IDF. Arabic-speaking soldiers and the IDF\u2019s medical team are reportedly at the hospital to ensure the supplies make it to those in need. The Israeli army alleges the main command center for Hamas is hidden inside the hospital, in underground tunnels beneath the structures that house hundreds of patients and medical staff. Both Hamas and al-Shifa Hospital staff deny the allegations. More than 11,200 Palestinians \u2014 two-thirds of them women and minors \u2014 have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. The Associated Press contributed to this update.

A Hamas training camp containing terror tunnel shafts, classrooms, intelligence material and dozens of weapons, including rockets and loaded RPGs, was located in the area on Tuesday by Israeli forces. In addition, the IDF said it struck two terrorists with a UAV after it identified a terrorist cell exiting a building with an anti-tank missile launching post in the northern Gaza Strip. The terrorists were carrying suspected IEDs, which were planted in the area. Fox News\u2019 Dana Karni contributed to this report.

On Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces revealed new details about Hamas\u2019 subterranean \u201cpit\u201d command center. Israeli soldiers were reportedly surprised by the level of sophistication of Hamas\u2019 underground high command quarters, drawing comparisons to the IDF\u2019s own \u201cpit\u201d beneath its Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv. The Hamas subterranean headquarters includes a special shaft with an elevator that can reportedly reach a depth of 30 meters (nearly 100 ft.) and fit seven people inside. The elevator descends to a specially- designed tunnel that is air conditioned and outfitted with oxygen. In addition, the tunnel includes advanced communication equipment, suggesting that top Hamas officials hide in there, including Gaza\u2019s Hamas chief Yahiya Sinwar and Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif. The Israeli military doctrine has traditionally focused on deterrence rather than dismantling the Hamas terror organizations. However, following the unprecedented Hamas massacre on Oct. 7 that claimed the lives of 1,200 Israelis and foreigners, mostly civilians, Israel has vowed to dismantle Hamas from the Gaza Strip. IDF Division 162 Commander Brig. Gen. Itzik Cohen stressed that the Israeli military is currently implementing the goal of eliminating Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities in Gaza City. \u201cWe created conditions which could lead to taking apart the military and governance capabilities of Hamas in Gaza City,\u201d Cohen explained. \u201cSince the start of the invasion, the IDF and Division 162 have been taking apart the centers of gravity of Hamas and the capabilities that it spent years building. Since the start of the invasion, divisional forces have killed over 1,000 Hamas terrorists and reduced rocket fire from northern Gaza at Israel by around 80%,\u201d the IDF general added. Earlier this week, Israeli forces from the Golani Brigade seized Hamas\u2019 parliament building in Gaza City, an important symbol of the Iranian-backed terror organization\u2019s political power in the coastal enclave. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a retired IDF general and former commando from the Shayetet 13 naval elite unit, recently said Hamas is unable to stop the Israeli advances throughout the Gaza Strip. \u201cHamas isn\u2019t capable of stopping the IDF. The IDF is advancing to every (necessary) location,\u201d Gallant stated. \u201cThe Hamas terrorist organization has lost control of Gaza, terrorists are fleeing south, civilians are looting Hamas bases, and they have no confidence in their government,\u201d he assessed. The Israeli army announced on Wednesday morning that it had launched \u201ca precise and targeted operation against Hamas\u201d in one part of the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The medical center has emerged as a hub for Hamas activities, including its command centers below the hospital. \u201cThe IDF is conducting a ground operation in Gaza to defeat Hamas and rescue our hostages. Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the civilians in Gaza,\u201d the Israeli military confirmed in an official statement. Hamas has systematically used hospitals, mosques, kindergartens, schools and private homes for storing weapons and hiding terrorist operatives. The IDF recently revealed that the Rantisi Children\u2019s Hospital, named after Hamas founder Abdel Aziz Rantisi, was being used for weapons storage and has likely been the location where Hamas has been hiding hostages for more than five weeks.

Category: Islamic News Tagged with: gaza Hamas headquarters idf Israel Terrorists War Israel\u2019s Netanyahu Rules Out Gaza\u00a0Cease-fire Friday, 03 November 2023 11:39 AM EDT Read more at https://www.newsmax.com/world/globaltalk/israel-hamas-war/2023/11/03/id/1140884/ The United States urged Israel on Friday to ensure more humanitarian aid gets into Gaza and to do more to protect Palestinian civilians, as Israel\u2019s prime minister said there would be no cease-fire in the nearly month-old war until Hamas releases hostages. The leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group stoked fears that the conflict could widen by promising more attacks along the Lebanon border. Israeli troops tightened their encirclement of Gaza City, the focus of their campaign to crush the enclave\u2019s ruling Hamas militants, who launched a brutal attack on Israeli communities that started the war. But ever since that Oct. 7 assault, there have been concerns the conflict could ignite fighting on other fronts, and Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah have repeatedly traded fire along the Lebanon border. In his first public speech since the war began, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said his group had \u201centered the battle\u201d\u00a0with the past weeks\u2019\u00a0unprecedented cross-border fighting. \u201cWe will not be limited to this,\u201d he said, suggesting escalation was possible. Still, Nasrallah stopped short of announcing that Hezbollah is fully engaging in the war. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on his third trip to Israel since the war began, reiterated U.S. support for Israel in the war, saying it has the right to defend itself. But he said a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d was needed to boost aid deliveries to Palestinian civilians amid growing alarm over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. After meeting Blinken, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel \u201crefuses a temporary cease-fire that doesn\u2019t include a return of our hostages,\u201d\u00a0referring to some 240 people Hamas abducted during its attack. He said Israel was pressing ahead with its military offensive with \u201call of its power.\u201d Blinken said there had to be a substantial and immediate increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza, where \u201cwe need to do more to protect Palestinian civilians.\u201d Without that, \u201cthere are no partners for peace,\u201d he said, adding that it was critical to restore the path toward a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, attacked Israeli military positions in northern Israel with drones, mortar fire and suicide drones on Thursday. The Israeli military said it retaliated with warplanes and helicopter gunships, and spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said civilians were wounded in the Hezbollah attacks. \u201cWe are in a high state of readiness in the north, in a very high state of alert, to respond to any event today and in coming days,\u201d\u00a0he said. Blinken said the U.S., which has deployed aircraft carriers and other forces in the eastern Mediterranean, was committed to ensuring that no \u201csecond or third front\u201d\u00a0opens in the conflict, referring to Hezbollah. In his speech, Nasrallah said his militia is not deterred by U.S. warnings, saying: \u201cYour fleets in the Mediterranean \u2026 will not scare us.\u201d A war with Hezbollah would be devastating for both Israel and Lebanon. Hezbollah is much stronger than Hamas, with an arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and missiles, some believed to be precision-guided weapons capable of striking deep inside Israel. Israel has promised to unleash vast destruction in Lebanon if all-out war erupts, accusing Hezbollah of hiding its military installation in the midst of residential areas. The two enemies fought an inconclusive monthlong war in 2006. Renewed fighting could also risk drawing Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, into the conflict. More than 9,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza so far, mostly women and minors, and more and than 23,000 people have been wounded, the Gaza Health Ministry said, without providing a breakdown between civilians and fighters. More than 1,400 people have died on the Israeli side, mainly civilians killed during Hamas\u2019 initial attack, when some 240 people were also taken hostage. Some 5,400 have also been injured. Twenty-four Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the ground operation. Since the start of the war, seven Israeli soldiers and a civilian have been killed in different incidents along Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon. As American officials have before, Blinken pledged unwavering support for Israel and its right to defend itself. \u201cWe stand strongly for the proposition that Israel has not only the right but the obligation to defend itself, and to make sure that October 7 should never happen again,\u201d said Blinken, who also plans to visit Amman, Jordan. It follows President Joe Biden\u2019s suggestion for a humanitarian \u201cpause\u201d\u00a0in the fighting. The aim would be to let in aid for Palestinians and let out more Palestinians who hold foreign passports and wounded. Around 800 people left Gaza over the past two days \u2014 the first time people departed the besieged territory other than four hostages released by Hamas and another rescued by Israeli forces. Blinken first held talks with Netanyahu behind closed doors before starting wider discussions with the leader and his War Cabinet and meeting with President Isaac Herzog. More than 3,700 Palestinian children have been killed in 25 days of fighting, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Bombardment has driven more than half the territory\u2019s 2.3 million people from their homes. Food, water and fuel are running low under Israel\u2019s siege, and overwhelmed hospitals warn they are on the verge of collapse. Israel has allowed more than 260 trucks carrying food and medicine into Gaza, but aid workers say it\u2019s not nearly enough. Israeli authorities have refused to allow fuel in, saying Hamas is hoarding fuel for military use and would steal new supplies. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. was not advocating for a general cease-fire but a \u201ctemporary, localized\u201d pause. Israel has not openly responded to Biden\u2019s suggestion. But Netanyahu, who has previously ruled out a cease-fire, said Thursday: \u201cWe are advancing. \u2026 Nothing will stop us.\u201d\u00a0He vowed to destroy Hamas rule in the Gaza Strip. Israel and the U.S. seem to have no clear plan for what would come next if Hamas rule in Gaza is brought down \u2014 a key question on Blinken\u2019s agenda during the visit, according to the State Department. Meanwhile, military officials said Israeli forces have now completely encircled Gaza City, a densely packed cluster of neighborhoods that Israel says is the center of Hamas military infrastructure and includes a vast network of underground tunnels, bunkers and command centers. Israeli forces are \u201cfighting in a built-up, dense, complex area,\u201d said the military\u2019s chief of staff, Herzi Halevy. Hagari, the military spokesperson, said Israeli forces were in \u201cface to face\u201d\u00a0battles with militants, calling in airstrikes and shelling when needed. He said they were inflicting heavy losses on Hamas fighters and destroying their infrastructure with engineering equipment. Hamas\u2019\u00a0military wing said early Friday that its fighters battled Israeli troops in several areas in Gaza and claimed they killed four soldiers on the northern edge of the city of Beit Lahiya. It also claimed to have destroyed several tanks with locally made anti-tank rockets. Neither the reports from Israel nor Hamas could be independently verified. Casualties on both sides were expected to rise as Israeli troops advance toward the dense residential neighborhoods of Gaza City. Israel has warned residents to immediately evacuate the Shati refugee camp, which borders Gaza City\u2019s center. But hundreds of thousands of Palestinians remain in the path of fighting in northern Gaza, despite Israel\u2019s repeated calls for them to flee. Many have crowded into U.N. facilities, hoping for safety. Still, four U.N. schools-turned-shelter in northern Gaza and Bureij were hit in recent days, killing 24 people, according to Philippe Lazzarini, general-secretary of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. In the occupied West Bank overnight, Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians in different places and arrested many more, according to the Israeli military and Palestinian health officials.

The U.S. military responded last Thursday to these strikes by bombing Iranian positions in Syria, and American forces will continue to target Tehran\u2019s proxy groups at will, the official said. Iran, the Pentagon assesses, is targeting American forces, threatening to drag the United States into a larger regional war. \u201cIt\u2019s about Iran and the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps], who use infrastructure, militants, and proxies on the ground across the Middle East to include both Iraq and Syria,\u201d the Defense Department official said, speaking only on background. \u201cWe reserve the right to respond at a time and place of our choosing, and we\u2019re going to continue to do so.\u201d \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d the official added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to respond when the president decides that\u2019s necessary for U.S. force protection.\u201d In the weeks since the Iran-backed terrorist group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing more than 1,400, Tehran\u2019s allies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen have stepped up their terrorism activities. These activities include rocket fire and shelling on Israel from areas in both Syria and Lebanon, where Hezbollah forces are stationed. Iran\u2019s assets in Iraq have also increased their strikes on American forces in the country, resulting in last week\u2019s military response by the United States. The Pentagon also said that Hamas militants are using hospitals and other civilian structures to conduct their terrorism operations against Israel. The Israeli military\u2019s foray into civilian areas of the Gaza Strip has fueled accusations that the country is intentionally targeting innocents, claims that have been amplified by anti-Israel U.S. lawmakers such as Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.). The Pentagon, however, says it has seen evidence that Hamas is using civilian structures as command centers. \u201cWhat I would say about Hamas is [its] use of civilian structures for command-and-control facilities and to hide weapons,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere is an abundance of public reporting about the ways in which Hamas uses civilians as human shields and civilian structures to hide and obfuscate tunnels, as well as weapons.\u201d This includes \u201cHamas\u2019s use of hospitals to emplace command-and-control infrastructure or other weapons that can be used against Israeli civilians.\u201d As of Monday afternoon, the Pentagon said it has no plans to facilitate \u201cmilitary-assisted departures\u201d for American citizens stuck in the region.

Have any of them ever loaded the blood-soaked bodies of his wounded and killed onto a medivac helicopter and then endured sleepless nights thinking about the visits their families are about to get and the ensuing destruction of their lives and dreams? These were the first questions that popped into my mind when I saw the report from\u00a0Politico that the Biden administration is promoting the war in Ukraine\u00a0because it is good for American business. I think the members of the administration could not have experienced these things because, if they had, and if they had one ounce of humanity in them, they could not possibly have promoted war on the \u201cit\u2019s good for business \u201d rationale. Apparently, multiple White House aides have been involved in this abomination because Politico is quite specific: The White House has been quietly urging lawmakers in both parties to\u00a0sell the war efforts abroad as a potential economic boom at home. Aides have been distributing talking points to Democrats and Republicans who have been supportive of continued efforts to fund Ukraine\u2019s resistance to make the case that\u00a0doing so is good for American jobs, according to five White House aides and lawmakers familiar with the effort and granted anonymity to speak freely. The Biden administration is fearful that it cannot sell its most recent aid package on the merits and on national security grounds, because \u201cThe talking points are an implicit recognition that the administration has work to do in selling its $106 billion foreign aid supplemental request \u2014\u00a0and that talking about it squarely under the umbrella of national security interests hasn\u2019t done the trick,\u201d Politico states. The reprehensibility of these comments cannot be overstated. Biden\u2019s administration is peopled with a number of \u201c elites \u201d who probably are familiar, at least in a theoretical, intellectual sense, with John Stuart Mill\u2019s dictum, \u201cWar is\u00a0an ugly thing.\u201d But, hey, if it\u2019s good for business, particularly in electoral swing states, let\u2019s go for it. I am old enough to remember how the left tarred George Bush, Dick Cheney, and others in the GOP with the argument that they wanted war because it was good for their supporters in big business. I never put any stock in these arguments because I thought no American could be so evil as to support war as a sop to big business. The Biden administration has changed my mind.

He also said he was redoubling his commitment to working on a two-state solution to end the decades-long Israel-Palestinian conflict. Biden said the attacks by \u201cextremist settlers\u201d amounted to \u201cpouring gasoline\u201d on the already burning fires in the Middle East since the Hamas attack. \u201cIt has to stop. They have to be held accountable. It has to stop now,\u201d Biden said at the start of a news conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who was being honored with a state visit to Washington. Settler violence against Palestinians has intensified since the Hamas attack, and Palestinians have been killed by settlers, according to Palestinian authorities. Rights groups say settlers have torched cars and attacked several small Bedouin communities, forcing them to evacuate to other areas. The West Bank Protection Consortium, a coalition of nongovernmental organizations and donor countries, including the European Union, says hundreds of Palestinians have been forcibly displaced in the West Bank due to settler violence since Oct. 7. That\u2019s in addition to over 1,100 displaced since 2022. Deadly violence has been surging in the West Bank as the Israeli military pursues Palestinian militants in the aftermath of the Hamas attack from Gaza. The violence threatens to open another front in the 2-week-old war, and puts pressure on the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank and is deeply unpopular among Palestinians, in large part because it cooperates with Israel on security matters. Biden again condemned the brutality of the Hamas attack that killed 1,400 Israelis and said that he was convinced that Hamas was driven in part by a desire undo U.S.-led efforts to normalize Israeli relations with some of its Arab neighbors, including Saudi Arabia. The president also said that after the Israel-Hamas conflict comes to an end, Israeli, Palestinians and their partners must work toward a two-state solution. \u201cTwo State solution\u201d. That is NOT a solution. The land the so-called Palestinians occupy was given them by Great Britton after Saudi Arabia kicked them out of the country. It is not their land. Naver have been their land, and God will demonstrate soon whose land it really belongs to. \u201cIsraelis and Palestinians equally deserve to live side by side in safety, dignity and peace,\u201d Biden said, adding, \u201cWhen this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next. And in our view, it has to be a two-state solution.\u201d The Hamas-run Health Ministry says more than 6,500 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in retaliatory strikes. Biden said that it was critical for Israel to move carefully in its response to minimize civilian deaths. \u201cIsrael should be incredibly careful to be sure that they\u2019re focusing on going after the folks that are propagating this war,\u201d Biden said. Biden also that he has not directly sought assurances from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel will hold off on an expected ground invasion into Gaza before hostages can be released. \u201cWhat I have indicated to him is that if that\u2019s possible, to get these folks out safely, that\u2019s what he should do. It\u2019s their decision,\u201d Biden said at news conference at the White House. \u201cBut I did not demand it. I pointed out to him, if it\u2019s real, it should be done.\u201d About 10 Americans remain unaccounted for amid the Israel-Hamas war, according to the White House. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.

Category: Political Tagged with: Biden Hamas Israel settlers War West Bank James Jay Carafano Op-ed: Yes, Biden calls out Hamas but he\u2019s oddly silent on 4 major issues hiding in plain\u00a0sight By James Jay Carafano Fox News | Published\u00a0October 11, 2023 10:18am EDT Read more at https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-hamas-oddly-silent-4-major-issues-hiding-plain-sight We\u2019re hearing a lot about what President Biden said in Tuesday\u2019s address on Hamas\u2019s outrageous attack on Israel. What\u2019s missing, though, is \u2026 well, what was missing. For while he was careful to denounce this brutal, inexcusable act of terrorism, Biden ignored the key role played by his own disastrous policies, and left Americans largely clueless as to how his administration would respond to this major test of U.S. leadership. Let\u2019s recap what we didn\u2019t hear: 1. Ghosting on Iran It is common knowledge that Biden was trying to buy the Iranians off with a massive payout for hostages . Add to this gaps in sanctions big enough for the biggest oil tankers to sail through, and virtual silence on Iran\u2019s human-rights record, support for terrorism, and destabilizing activities in the region and Latin America. Video Biden had hoped that Iran would keep a low profile, at least until after the 2024 elections. Tehran\u2019s payback to the U.S. and Biden was not only to cheerlead as Hamas terrorists decapitated babies, but to likely assist in supporting and planning the terror campaign. BIDEN SHUNS CALLS TO DE-ESCALATE, VOWS US \u2018HAS ISRAEL\u2019S BACK\u2019 AS IT PREPARES FOR GROUND WAR WITH HAMAS The president could not even bring himself to mention Iran in his speech on Tuesday. That\u2019s a clear signal the administration is clueless what to do now that it\u2019s been hit with irrefutable evidence that its Iran policy has utterly and completely failed. 2. Ignoring Russia Russia has declared itself all in for Hamas, a marked shift in Moscow policy . Further, there are reports that Russian mercenaries may have assisted in training and preparing Hamas\u2019s shock troops. And there are additional reports Russians smuggled captured arms to the Hamas and then spread a false-flag that these arms were sold by Ukrainians to Hamas on the black market. Video Both Russia and Iran clearly believe that a spiraling war in the Middle East will overstretch and distract the United States. Meanwhile, Biden, who has never articulated a clear strategy for Ukraine , now gives us a \u201cno plan\u201d plan for dealing with a dual global crisis. All we have from the White House is that Ukraine can expect a blank check for as long as it takes. For Israel, we get finger-wagging at Israel not to over-react. The signal this sends to both Moscow and Tehran is that Washington is just making this up as it goes along. It\u2019s Amateur Night writ large at a time when we need true professionals at work. 3. Gaslighting on the Border Israel gets hammered with Pearl Harbor from Gaza with virtually no warning. Meanwhile, the U.S. has the most open border on earth. Millions of illegals have poured into the U.S. without even being observed by border agents, let alone vetted. Video We know that this flood includes people from all over the world. We know it includes people on terrorist watchlists. We know this because in recent months we have culled unprecedented numbers of them at the border. The odds that they\u2019re the only ones are less than zero. Yet in his speech Tuesday, the president had nothing to reassure Americans that he\u2019s prepared to safeguard Americans from the next 9/11. 4. Antisemitism Gets a Pass A long list of yahoos, from the \u201cSquad\u201d in Congress to BLM to radicals at Ivy League universities , have reacted to Hamas\u2019s atrocities by attacking Israel. The president has a deep, insidious, and pernicious problem with antisemitism in his own party. Tuesday\u2019s speech presented a perfect opportunity for him to call them out and declare it unacceptable. He didn\u2019t take it. The White House staff is probably proud that Biden could muster the energy, after hosting a BBQ, to deliver what was largely a boilerplate speech. But Americans looking for real leadership can\u2019t help being disappointed by a president who appears to be going through the motions at a uniquely critical time.

Category: Political Tagged with: Israel James Jay Carafano Joe Biden War Biden: Hamas Attack \u2018Act of Sheer Evil,\u2019 Worse Than\u00a0ISIS Tuesday, 10 October 2023 02:45 PM EDT (Newsmax) Read more at https://www.newsmax.com/politics/president-joe-biden-speech-israel/2023/10/10/id/1137751/ President Joe Biden on Tuesday said the United States \u201chas Israel\u2019s back\u201d and will ensure that Israel can \u201cdefend itself\u201d in light of the Hamas terrorist attack during the weekend. In a speech from the White House,\u00a0Biden said American citizens were among those held by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas after its weekend attack on Israel that left hundreds dead. He said 14 U.S. citizens had been killed by the terrorists. The White House later said the State Department had been in contact with the families of those\u00a0Americans killed. Biden also said the U.S. would surge additional equipment to Israel, including interceptor missiles for the Iron Dome system. Biden said U.S. law enforcement agencies were taking steps to disrupt any domestic threat that may emerge after Hamas\u2019 attack. The FBI said earlier it was \u201cclosely monitoring unfolding events\u201d but added it \u201cdoes not have specific and credible intelligence indicating a threat to the United States stemming from the Hamas attacks in Israel.\u201d Earlier Tuesday, Biden said he discussed support for Israel in his call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday after meeting with U.S. national security teams \u201cto direct next steps.\u201d \u201cWe connected with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss coordination to support Israel, deter hostile actors, and protect innocent people,\u201d Biden said in a social media post before making public remarks on the situation in Israel. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke by phone with\u00a0Netanyahu to discuss the situation on the ground. Biden, in his previous public remarks and statements since Hamas launched its attacks, has repeatedly emphasized his shock over the breadth and brutality of the Hamas assault \u2014 a blitz by land, sea and air that surprised Israeli and U.S. intelligence and that has killed hundreds Israelis and left even more wounded. Retaliatory strikes by Israel on the Gaza Strip have also left hundreds of dead and wounded Palestinians in the blockaded 141-square mile area, one the poorest patches of territory in the world. The death toll was expected to grow as Israel pummeled Gaza with airstrikes and sent tens of thousands of Palestinians fleeing into U.N. shelters. The White House on Monday confirmed that it has already begun delivering critically needed munitions and military equipment to Israel, and the Pentagon was reviewing its inventories to see what else can be sent quickly to boost its ally in the war against Hamas. The U.S. Ford carrier strike group has arrived in the far Eastern Mediterranean, within range to provide a host of air support or long-range strike options for Israel if requested, but also to surge U.S. military presence there to prevent the war from spilling over into a more dangerous regional conflict, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the arrival ahead of an announcement. The Pentagon has said that the U.S. warplanes, destroyers and cruisers that sailed with the Ford will conduct maritime and air operations which could include intelligence collection, interdictions and long-range strikes. Along with the Ford, the U.S. is sending the cruiser USS Normandy and destroyers USS Thomas Hudner, USS Ramage, USS Carney, and USS Roosevelt, and the U.S. is augmenting Air Force F-35, F-15, F-16, and A-10 fighter aircraft squadrons in the region. Biden on Monday in a joint statement with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak underscored the \u201clegitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people\u201d\u00a0and their decades-long push for sovereignty. But the leaders also sought to separate the Palestinians\u2019 aspirations from the \u201cappalling acts of terrorism\u201d by Hamas. Americans have had a gloomy outlook on Biden\u2019s performance on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Six in 10 Americans (61%) disapproved of how Biden was handling the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, according to an August poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About one-third (35%) of U.S. adults approved, which was slightly lower than Biden\u2019s overall approval rating of 42% in the same poll. Four in 10 Americans (44%) said the U.S. gives about the right amount of support to Israel in the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Republicans were more likely than Democrats to say the U.S. should offer more support to Israel. Four in 10 Americans (42%) said the correct amount of support is given to the Palestinians. Democrats and Independents were more likely than Republicans to say the Palestinians should receive more support. The current crisis seems certain to further test public sentiment about Biden\u2019s Mideast foreign policy approach. The Biden White House has pointed to its handling of the last conflict between Israel and Gaza in 2021 as playing a crucial part in limiting the length and loss of life in a war that stretched over 11 days and killed at least 250 people in Gaza and 13 in Israel. During the 2021 conflict, Biden limited his public commentary while pressing Netanyahu in private to end the conflict. His behind-the-scenes effort played out even as some of the president\u2019s fellow Democrats pressured him to speak out against the Israelis as the death toll climbed in Gaza and as tens of thousands of Palestinians were displaced by the aerial bombardment, White House officials said at the time. But this conflict is unlikely to end so quickly. Domestic and international pressure could quickly mount on Biden to pressure Netanyahu to wind down operations to prevent the suffering of innocent Gazans. Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

Category: Political Tagged with: brutality Hamas Israel President Joe Biden speech War 28 Republicans Reject Biden Administration\u2019s Demands to Fund Indefinite Proxy War in\u00a0Ukraine BY: JORDAN BOYD | SEPTEMBER 21, 2023 Read more at https://thefederalist.com/2023/09/21/republicans-say-no-to-funding-indefinite-war-in-ukraine/ JORDAN BOYD VISIT ON TWITTER @JORDANBOYDTX MORE ARTICLES Twenty-eight Republicans publicly vowed on Thursday to oppose the use of billions of American tax dollars to fund a proxy war in Ukraine. The rejection, sent in a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young, is a direct response to the Biden administration\u2019s recent demand that Congress send $24 billion more in American taxpayer-funded resources to Volodymyr Zelensky in an attempt to curb Vladimir Putin and his regime. Sen. J.D. Vance, who spearheaded the letter, said Congress should not keep funding \u201can indefinite conflict\u201d without more fact-based information about the war. \u201cYesterday at a classified briefing over Ukraine, it became clear that America is being asked to fund an indefinite conflict with unlimited resources,\u201d Vance wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cEnough is enough. To these and future requests, my colleagues and I say: NO.\u201d More than half of the nation says Congress should stop financing Ukraine, a country plagued by corruption . Yet, President Joe Biden, his cabinet members, and even establishment Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have repeatedly pledged to support the war \u201cfor as long as it takes.\u201d President Biden in Vilnius, Lithuania as he departs NATO Summit: \"We will not waver. Our commitment to Ukraine will not weaken. We will stand for liberty and freedom today, tomorrow, and for as long as it takes.\" pic.twitter.com/eTQWSlQ2bA \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) July 12, 2023 Retiring Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley reportedly received a \u201cstanding ovation\u201d on Wednesday after he also swore that \u201cthe United States will continue to provide support to Ukraine for as long as it takes.\u201d \u201cMy tenure may be ending but the mission for this group continues until the end state of a free and sovereign Ukraine is attained,\u201d Milley said.

Mark Milley on sending aid to Ukraine: \"As President Biden and Secretary Austin have said many, many times over, we, the United States, will continue to provide support to Ukraine for as long as it takes.\" pic.twitter.com/4aNRcWutBJ \u2014 Jeff Charles, An Awful Pundit\ud83c\udff4 (@jeffcharlesjr) September 21, 2023 \u201cThese statements imply an open-ended commitment to supporting the war in Ukraine of an indeterminate nature, based on a strategy that is unclear, to achieve a goal yet to be articulated to the public or the Congress,\u201d the signees wrote. The statements also lack any transparency about how the nation\u2019s previous aid was used. In their letter, the Republicans note the whopping $114 billion total often used to measure U.S. funding for Ukraine \u201cdoes not reflect the full picture, which includes transferred and reprogrammed funds.\u201d They add that in all five of its \u201csupplemental requests\u201d for Ukraine funding to Congress, the Biden administration \u201crequested additional authority to transfer and reprogram funds.\u201d \u201cThe vast majority of Congress remains unaware of how much the United States has spent to date in total on this conflict, information which is necessary for Congress to prudently exercise its appropriations power,\u201d the Republicans warn. The ignorance is not due to a lack of curiosity from the Republicans behind the letter, who have made multiple inquiries over the last two years demanding more information. In January, Vance and three dozen other Republicans in Congress signed a letter to Young demanding a \u201cfull accounting\u201d of U.S. aid to Ukraine. Their requests went largely unaddressed. \u201cIt is difficult to envision a benign explanation for this lack of clarity,\u201d the Republicans state. As prime examples of the executive branch\u2019s reckless Ukraine spending spree, the GOPers highlighted the Department of Defense\u2019s recent $6.2 billion Ukraine aid accounting error and the Biden administration\u2019s $5 billion request for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a number which exceeded 15 times what Congress allotted in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act. \u201cThe American people deserve to know what their money has gone to. How is the counteroffensive going? Are the Ukrainians any closer to victory than they were 6 months ago? What is our strategy, and what is the president\u2019s exit plan? What does the administration define as victory in Ukraine?\u201d the GOPers ask. To grant another round of Ukraine funding requests by the Biden administration without \u201canswers to these questions,\u201d the GOP members declared, would be \u201can absurd abdication of congressional responsibility.\u201d The 28 Republicans pledge to keep their purse strings closed until the Biden administration explains its funding frenzy to Congress and taxpayers.

Dangerous.\u201d \u2014 French , New York Times columnist \u201c[DeSantis] has decided that if you can\u2019t beat the pro-Putin wing of the Republican Party, then join them.

Ron DeSantis\u2019 recently released statement about the ongoing war in Ukraine (a place our elected leaders in Washington sometimes refer to as \u201cOur Last Great Hope.\u201d) What he said more fully is that \u201cbecoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia\u201d is not a \u201cvital interest\u201d to the United States. That\u2019s a view shared by anyone who thinks yet another foreign war without clear and substantial strategic benefit to America is not something we should busy ourselves with. (It\u2019s not like we have any pressing problems here!) But French, Rubin and the rest of the national media really hate that view. It\u2019s \u201cpro-Putin\u201d! It\u2019s \u201castonishing\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d! DeSantis should say it one more time for the people in the back. The war is literally a dispute over territory. Russian leadership claims Ukraine as its own and the Kremlin\u2019s settlement offers are based almost solely on territory concessions (with some details related to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization). \u201cI believe that Russians and Ukrainians are one people \u2026 one nation, in fact,\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin said in 2019 .

The Washington Post last year found at least 15 percent of residents of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region said they wanted to join Russia . Maybe, just maybe, this has something to do with Russia and Ukraine being literally part of the same nation for more than half a century. I know that\u2019s not very sexy for the nerds in the media who prefer to think of the war like a Marvel movie where a corny villain can be overpowered by a united and freedom-loving Justice League, but that\u2019s not the case. Democracy is at stake! *Cue Max Boot solemnly removing his little hat in reverence.* It turns out that discussing the conflict doesn\u2019t first require the speakers to confess their love for Ukraine and hatred for Putin while shedding a tear.

Category: Foreign Policy , International Politics , Military Tagged with: David French FOREIGN WARS Jennifer Rubin Media Ron DeSantis Russia Ukraine UKRAINE WAR Vladimir Putin War Biden Declares U.S. Will Sustain War In Eastern Europe Indefinitely, Against Americans\u2019\u00a0Wishes BY: JORDAN BOYD | FEBRUARY 21, 2023 Read more at https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/21/biden-declares-u-s-will-sustain-war-in-eastern-europe-indefinitely-against-americans-wishes/ Less than 24 hours after his staged trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, President Joe Biden told thousands of spectators in Warsaw, Poland, that he plans to indefinitely squander U.S. taxpayer dollars on a proxy war, despite Americans indicating they oppose this involvement. \u201cOur support for Ukraine will not waver, NATO will not be divided, and we will not tire,\u201d Biden yelled on Tuesday during his occasionally incoherent remarks. The event was promoted as a somber affair to mark one year since Russia invaded Ukraine. Biden\u2019s speech, however, kicked off with the light-hearted air of a campaign stop, featuring background music by the Foo Fighters and Coldplay and photo opportunities with children waving American, Polish, and Ukrainian flags. Back home, Americans plagued with sky-high inflation, a growing border crisis, and hazardous chemical spills are not as enthused by Biden\u2019s words. Less than half of Americans support shipping weapons and cash to the Eastern European country, especially because, with no oversight , those funds are lining the pockets of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose regime is plagued with allegations of corruption . Despite Americans\u2019 opposition to prolonging an overseas war, Biden falsely claimed to his audience in Poland that Americans \u201care united in our resolve\u201d to sponsor the Zelensky regime \u201cfor as long as it takes.\u201d Biden cited showy Ukraine flag virtue-signaling campaigns and Congress\u2019s assistance in sending $113 billion taxpayer dollars and counting to Zelenksy as proof that Americans want to keep handing over blank checks to a foreign government. \u201cAll across my country, in big cities and small towns, Ukrainian flags fly from American homes. Over the past year, Democrats and Republicans in the United States Congress have come together to stand for freedom. That\u2019s who Americans are, that\u2019s what Americans do,\u201d Biden said. In a full embrace of the uniparty\u2019s interventionist agenda , Biden claimed this commitment to \u201cthe people of Ukraine and the future of Ukraine\u201d is rooted in the belief that Ukraine should be a \u201cfree, sovereign, and democratic\u201d nation. \u201cThere\u2019s no sweeter word than freedom. There is no nobler goal than freedom. There\u2019s no higher aspiration than freedom. Americans know that, and you know it,\u201d Biden said. While his homeland crumbles , Biden touts dragging the U.S. into a global war in the name of advancing \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201csovereignty\u201d overseas with no word about the negotiations required for de-escalation . On the contrary, Biden said the only end to this war he will accept is Russia ceasing its invasion, something President Vladimir Putin said he doesn\u2019t plan to do. \u201cIf Russia stopped invading Ukraine, it would end the war. If Ukraine stopped defending itself against Russia, [it] would be the end of Ukraine,\u201d Biden said. Jordan Boyd is a staff writer at The Federalist and co-producer of The Federalist Radio Hour.

Hiding from his crimes against Americans and our Constitution by urging atrocities in Ukraine. JOY PULLMANN VISIT ON TWITTER @JOYPULLMANN MORE ARTICLES Americans received a pristine view of Democrats\u2019 disastrous America-Last policies this morning as Joe Biden paid a surprise visit to Ukraine while his own country literally burns with manmade disasters he continues to inflame. Biden\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency denied any money to help clean up a burning chemical disaster zone in the Republican state of Ohio, but Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear that Biden will get a blank check to slosh around hundreds of billions from U.S. taxpayers to prolong the carnage of war in Ukraine \u2014 and the profits from it from insane deficit spending that also threatens U.S. national security. Not only is key U.S. infrastructure on fire stateside, but Biden, in violation of his oath of office, also set the U.S. border figuratively on fire immediately upon assuming the presidency by lifting former President Trump\u2019s effective enforcement of U.S. national security laws. Cities and towns across the United States are overwhelmed with mass human trafficking and the outsourcing of U.S. border control to international drug cartels allied with the top U.S. foreign adversary, Red China. It\u2019s no surprise that American support for expanding the U.S. proxy war with Russia is declining . They can see that their neighbors have to pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for health insurance even if they never see a doctor because they\u2019re r eally paying off the health expenses of illegal migrants, and that their neighbors are dying from the fentanyl trafficked with the human flood of misery across the border. And where is Biden as his country is in flames? Hiding from his crimes against Americans, our laws, and our Constitution by urging continued atrocities while doing a dog and pony show in Ukraine. While forcing his own people \u2014 and those whose migration keeps the cartels supplied with the billions to buy military-grade weaponry \u2014 to suffer murder, rape, and other heinous crimes, Biden is abroad encouraging ongoing violence in Ukraine. War is hell, especially for the vulnerable \u2014 women, children, and the elderly. But Democrats and their military-industrial complex believe death, rape, starvation, and continued demolishing of Ukranian homes and towns are a worthy trade for a shiny new excuse to open U.S. coffers wide to high-dollar campaign donors with no oversight . It\u2019s no coincidence, surely, the dollar spigots are also flooding toward the very same country that supplied millions to politically influence Biden\u2019s family \u2014 and, according to his family, to influence Biden himself. This is Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cmission accomplished\u201d moment. Or, it would be, if the hapless and embarrassing George W. Bush were as patently evil as the Democrats running Biden. Remember, six weeks after he invaded Iraq, Bush stood in front of a banner proclaiming \u201cMission Accomplished.\u201d U.S. troops remained in Iraq and Afghanistan for 20 more years, spending precious soldiers\u2019 lives and trillions in American treasure to weaken our national security by distracting us from higher foreign policy priorities, such as China. Right after Bush gave the \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d speech, Iraqi insurgents redoubled their efforts. U.S. Navy Photo by Photographer\u2019s Mate Third Class Juan E. Diaz. Public domain / Wikimedia Democrats\u2019 media mouthpieces may have controlled U.S. discourse so much that only the brave like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis can point out the foolhardiness of tempting another world war by refusing to seek peace for Ukraine. But the rest of the world is not fooled. They\u2019re aware that Democrats are weak, that they hate America, and that they are willing to sell the labor, security, and peace of their American brethren to the highest bidder. Biden may be trying to look tough by visiting Ukraine weeks after allowing Chinese spy balloons to traverse the United States and then shooting down $6 hobby balloons with $400,000 missiles. But the only person he\u2019s fooling is himself. Biden\u2019s weakness is the Democratic Party\u2019s weakness is the U.S. foreign policy cabal\u2019s weakness. And weakness invites aggression. Photo ops are not going to reduce the threat of a world war. Patently weak appearances by Biden in fact escalate the threat of world war. Seeking to de-escalate is the only prudent choice. We all had better pray someone with power figures that out before China and Russia continue to align against us. History tells what happens when leaders fiddle after setting their cities ablaze.

TOBIN | JULY 27, 2022 Read more at https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/27/as-ukrainians-defect-to-russia-we-should-ask-whether-our-billions-are-saving-democracy-or-aiding-corruption/ The more we learn about Ukraine, the less it resembles the Jeffersonian democracy Biden tries to conjure up in his speeches on the subject. JONATHAN S. TOBIN VISIT ON TWITTER @JONATHANS_TOBIN MORE ARTICLES The first lady of Ukraine was in Washington last week to be feted by the Biden administration, Congress, and the corporate press. Olena Zelenska, the attractive and patriotically dressed wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was given the Jackie Kennedy/Michelle Obama treatment by fashion columnists while also helping to reinforce the message that Ukraine\u2019s effort to defend itself against Russian aggression is a battle for democracy and the survival of the West. This is an easy story to tell a receptive American audience. Since the war began in February, American sympathy combined with the stiffer-than-expected struggle put up by Ukrainian forces and Zelensky\u2019s deft public relations campaign has reinforced the message that the Kyiv government is a democracy whose defense is essential to Western security. Yet the question to be posed about this is not whether Russia and Putin are bad but whether Ukraine is the paragon of democracy Biden says it is. Congress recently passed a $40 billion aid package for Ukraine in May with bipartisan support. Grassroots Republicans and even portions of the Democratic base have been critical of the way Ukraine\u2019s security has come to dictate national priorities. That $40 billion is likely to be only the first installment of a steady flow of aid to pay for the $10 billion per month that the war is costing Kyiv. That\u2019s what made the appearance of a story about Ukraine in The New York Times this past week, which showed a different side of Zelensky\u2019s government, so significant. The story, titled \u201cZelenskyy Fires Two Top Law Enforcement Officials,\u201d buried the lead. The Times emphasized the fact that this was the first government shakeup in Kyiv since the war started as well as the fact that one of the two people fired was a boyhood friend of Zelensky. But while that is true, the substance of the story was that the sympathy and support for the Russians among a not insignificant portion of the Ukrainian population and members of the security services has damaged the war effort. An earlier story in the Times discussed how paranoia about potential Russian spies had spread throughout Ukrainian society. The latest dispatch made clear just how much of an issue this had become. It\u2019s one thing to report about 200,000 spy allegations being submitted to Ukrainian authorities every month. Zelensky\u2019s sacking of security measures made clear how \u201ctreason\u201d cases have become something of an obsession for the Ukrainian government. Even more alarming is the fact that several hundred of these treason investigations involved security personnel. Many Ukrainian officials, including those who were employed by the prosecutor\u2019s office, remained behind in Russian-occupied territory and are now working for Moscow. Still, that partly explains the large number of Ukrainian personnel helping the Russians. But the way this vast security state has been empowered by the war to turn its malevolent gaze on Ukrainian citizens \u2014 whether guilty of sympathy for Moscow or not \u2014 is chilling. Previously, Ukraine was widely acknowledged to be as corrupt as the rest of the former Soviet Union, with a fledgling democratic system that was far from entirely free. Even after Zelensky became president, newspapers that were critical of his government were shut down. Since the war started, journalists have struggled to retain their ability to report freely and fairly. That the majority of Ukrainians want their country to remain independent is obvious. So is their willingness to fight to prevent their nation from falling under Putin\u2019s thumb. But the ability of the Russians to get so many Ukrainians to sympathize with or aid their assault on Ukraine illustrates that what is going on is, in part, a civil war as well as a foreign invasion. Yet equally true is the fact that the Ukrainian state that is being defended so bravely is still deeply flawed and possessed of attributes antithetical to democracy. Though some of its problems would be present in any country at war and under direct attack, the more we learn about Ukraine, the less it resembles the Jeffersonian democracy that Biden tries to conjure up in his speeches on the subject. While sympathy for Ukraine and hostility to Russia is understandable, these are factors that ought to be taken into consideration if the United States is to undertake the kind of financial commitment in this war that is starting to remind us of the disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Or, at least, it should if Americans are to be permitted to have a debate about making such a dubious commitment. Jonathan S.

Don\u2019t Think They Won\u2019t\u00a0Again REPORTED BY: ELLE REYNOLDS | MARCH 17, 2022 Read more at https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/17/the-press-has-lied-to-drag-the-united-states-into-war-before-dont-think-they-wont-again/ The night of Feb. 15, 1898, the U.S. battleship Maine sat at anchor in Havana, Cuba. A few minutes after 9 p.m., the nightly ritual of \u201cTaps\u201d from Fifer C. H. Newton\u2019s bugle descended over the ship. Some half an hour later, the forward end of the ship rose suddenly above the water. \u201cAlong the pier, passersby could hear a rumbling explosion,\u201d detailed author Tom Miller. \u201cWithin seconds, another eruption \u2014 this one deafening and massive \u2014 splintered the bow, sending anything that wasn\u2019t battened down, and most that was, flying more than 200 feet into the air.\u201d The explosion, which killed more than 250 men on board, was quickly memorialized with cries of \u201cRemember the Maine !\u201d Without directly accusing Spain, which controlled Cuba at the time, a U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry decided a month later that the explosion was from a mine. (A U.S. Navy investigation decades later found it was likely an accidental coal bunker fire.) Shortly afterward, the United States declared war on Spain, starting the Spanish-American War. One of the biggest warmongering forces in America, capitalizing on the Maine \u2018s explosion, was the press \u2014 a position American media pundits continue to hold as they work overtime to drag Americans into a war with Russia over Ukraine. When you see talking heads uncritically parroting propagandist stories about Ukraine that turn out to be false, from the \u201c Ghost of Kyiv \u201d to that Snake Island story to old photos taken years ago, you should be asking why the corporate media is so willing to spread such fake news (while it censors conservatives for factual critiques of disproven Covid narratives, no less). It wouldn\u2019t be the first time the press lied to pull Americans into war. How Newspapermen Helped Start a War in Cuba It was the so-called golden age of newspapers, after the influence of the Industrial Revolution gave rise to the \u201cpenny press\u201d \u2014 newspapers you could buy at the street corner without a subscription. Competing magnates like William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer fought for readers, and they did so by trying to produce the most sensational news possible. As the story goes, in the year before the Maine exploded, Hearst had commissioned reporter Frederic Remington to go to Cuba, where Cuban revolutionaries were skirmishing with their Spanish colonizers. When Remington sent Hearst a wire to explain he was leaving Cuba because there was no war to cover, Hearst reportedly replied , \u201cYou furnish the pictures and I\u2019ll furnish the war.\u201d After the sinking of the Maine , headlines like \u201cSpanish Treachery!\u201d and \u201cDestruction of the War Ship Maine Was the Work of an Enemy!\u201d and \u201cInvasion!\u201d and \u201cWho Destroyed the Maine ? $50,000 Reward\u201d splashed across front pages. The United States went to war in April, two months after the Maine perished. The media\u2019s eagerness to gin up a war mirrored the push for involvement from other voices in politics and culture. Some Americans had sympathy for Spanish-owned Cuba as fellow colonial revolutionaries, while others wanted to see U.S. influence and territory expand internationally. Half a century prior, when the phrase \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d was being coined, the United States had gone to war with Mexico over Texas but also ended the war with acquisitions of what is now California, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. By 1898, the United States had purchased Alaska from Russia and claimed several Pacific islands. Many Americans saw a similar opportunity for territorial expansion in a fight with Spain over Cuba. Sure enough, the United States exited the Spanish-American War with new acquisitions from Guam to the Philippines to Puerto Rico. While the warmongers weren\u2019t limited to the press, they were certainly concentrated there. The State Department Office of the Historian writes : \u201cHearst and Pulitzer devoted more and more attention to the Cuban struggle for independence, at times accentuating the harshness of Spanish rule or the nobility of the revolutionaries, and occasionally printing rousing stories that proved to be false.\u201d Sound familiar? A Century of Dishonesty \u201cRemember the\u00a0Maine!\u201d may have been at the height of the yellow journalism era, but it was certainly not the last instance of dishonest reporting in favor of sensational warmongering. During the Spanish Civil War, which saw Nationalist revolutionaries clash with Republicans in the years directly preceding World War II, some Western outlets were criticized for covering the conflict sensationally. The New York Times devoted far more manpower to the war than papers at the time traditionally did, with \u201c highly partisan \u201d perspectives. George Orwell, who fought alongside Republican forces, wrote in his memoir \u201cHomage to Catalonia\u201d that \u201cfor the first time, I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts, not even the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie.\u201d \u201cI saw great battles reported where there had been no fighting, and complete silence where hundreds of men had been killed. I saw troops who had fought bravely denounced as cowards and traitors, and others who had never seen a shot fired hailed as heroes of imaginary victories; and I saw newspapers in London retailing these lies and eager intellectuals building emotional superstructures over events that never happened,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI saw, in fact, history being written not in terms of what happened but of what ought to have happened according to various \u2018party lines.\u2019\u201d Newspaper propagandists\u2019 willingness to cover wars in self-interested ways didn\u2019t always run in the same direction, either. Orwell\u2019s contemporary and fellow writer Ernest Hemingway had similar criticism for propagandist writers who downplayed the carnage of World War I, insisting it was \u201cthe most colossal, murderous, mismanaged butchery that has ever taken place on earth. Any writer who said otherwise lied, So the writers either wrote propaganda, shut up, or fought.\u201d Later in the 20th century, The New York Times\u2019 Berlin bureau chief Guido Enderis was providing friendly coverage of Hitler\u2019s Germany, according to writer Ashley Rindsberg\u2019s book \u201cThe Gray Lady Winked.\u201d Meanwhile, the paper\u2019s Moscow correspondent Walter Duranty, Rindsberg noted, was downplaying Joseph Stalin\u2019s role in the 1932-33 famine in Ukraine because \u201cat the time, The New York Times was actively pushing for American recognition of the Soviet Union.\u201d President Franklin Roosevelt obliged, recognizing the USSR in 1933. A more recent example is that of The New York Times and other corporate media outlets reporting baseless stories about the existence of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq to gin up support for President George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq in 2003. A year afterward, the Times editors admitted their lopsided reporting on the matter in a lengthy editorial piece. \u201cWe have found a number of instances of coverage that was not as rigorous as it should have been,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIn some cases, information that was controversial then, and seems questionable now, was insufficiently qualified or allowed to stand unchallenged.\u201d \u201cAdministration officials now acknowledge that they sometimes fell for misinformation from these [Iraqi] exile sources. So did many news organizations \u2014 in particular, this one,\u201d the editors continued. With the rapid dissemination of sensational photos, videos, and information via social media today, there\u2019s no indication the corporate press is any less immune to disinformation when it fits their narrative . When you see corporate outlets rushing us into war in Europe with sensational stories and flat-out dishonest polling , think twice. The corrupt media has lied to drag Americans into war before, and none of their recent lies on other issues should incline you to think they won\u2019t do it again.

A Kremlin spokesman identified the terms on Monday, according to Reuters . First, Dmitry Peskov said, Ukraine must halt all military action. Russian propaganda has consistently invoked the \u201c demilitarization \u201d of Ukraine as an objective of the invasion, demanding that one of the largest countries in Europe remain defenseless. Second, Russia wants Ukraine to recognize Crimea as Russian territory. Trending: Rep Waltz: Ukrainians Have Been Begging for US Stinger Missiles Since December, But Biden Held Off Until It Was Too Late Russia forcibly annexed Crimea in 2014, seizing the region of southern Ukraine in response to growing pro-NATO and European Union sentiment in the former Soviet republic. Third, Ukraine must recognize two regions of its territory as independent countries, following Russia\u2019s recognition of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic last month. Pro-Russian secessionist groups control population centers within the two regions of Eastern Ukraine, where conflict has occurred since 2014. Such a move could lead to Russian annexation of Donetsk and Luhansk. After Russian troops poured into Crimea in 2014, the region was briefly declared an \u201cindependent country\u201d before its inhabitants supposedly voted to join Russia while facing the gun barrel of a Russian military occupation. \u201cWe have also spoken about how they should recognize that Crimea is Russian territory and that they need to recognize that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states,\u201d Peskov told Reuters in a telephone interview. Finally, Russia wants Ukraine to amend its constitution to bar the country from pursuing NATO membership. \u201cThey should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc,\u201d Peskov said, according to Reuters. \u201cAnd that\u2019s it. It will stop in a moment,\u201d he said. Related: Japan Moving to Rebuild Its Military in \u2018Big Awakening\u2019 Peskov said Ukraine was aware of the conditions. The list of demands was outlined as Russian and Ukrainian diplomats begin a new round of talks at the border of Belarus and Poland. Some Ukrainian leaders, such as former President Petro Poroshenko, have expressed doubt that negotiations will lead anywhere. The terms, which undermine the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, are extremely unlikely to lead to a diplomatic agreement to end the conflict.

Category: International Politics Tagged with: Europe Military Propaganda Russia Ukraine Vladimir Putin Volodymyr Zelenskyy War World News Million-Dollar Bounty Placed on Vladimir\u00a0Putin Reported By Abby Liebing |\u00a0March 3, 2022 Read more at https://www.westernjournal.com/million-dollar-bounty-placed-vladimir-putin/ A bounty has been put out for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Alex Konanykhin, a Russian businessman, has offered a $1 million bounty to Russian officers to arrest Putin as a war criminal, Business Insider reported. \u201cI promise to pay $1,000,000 to the officer(s) who, complying with their constitutional duty, arrest(s) Putin as a war criminal under Russian and international laws. Putin is not the Russian president as he came to power as the result of a special operation of blowing up apartment buildings in Russia, then violated the Constitution by eliminating free elections and murdering his opponents,\u201d Konanykhin wrote in a Facebook post . The explosion to which Konanykhin referred is part of a theory that the Russian Federal Security Service, of which Putin was head from 1998 to 1999, blew up apartments in 1999, then blamed it on Chechens. That explosion, was part of what sparked the Second Chechen War, an effort that made Putin very popular in Russia. In 1999, Putin became the Russian prime minister, before being named acting president on Dec. 31 of that year. He was elected to the presidency in March 2000,\u00a0the Independent reported. With obvious animosity, Konanykhin also noted that he felt it was his duty to oppose Putin\u2019s war and keep assisting Ukraine against the Russian president. \u201cAs an ethnic Russian and a Russia citizen, I see it as my moral duty to facilitate the denazification of Russia. I will continue my assistance to Ukraine in its heroic efforts to withstand the onslaught of Putin\u2019s Orda,\u201d he added in his post. Konanykhin\u2019s original Facebook post included a photo of Putin, with the caption, \u201cWanted: Dead or alive. Vladimir Putin for mass murder,\u201d the Independent reported. Facebook then banned his post. But Konanykhin then re-posted with just the text informing about his bounty offer. \u201cFacebook banned my post; do you think it was a correct decision? I omit the picture as it was a \u2018dead or alive\u2019 poster, but this is the text,\u201d he wrote. Konanykhin is one of the many Russian businessmen who rose to wealth and prominence after the collapse of the Soviet Union , according to Newsweek . Konanykhin said he has not visited Russia since 1992, Business Insider reported. The Russian businessman has a complicated history with the Russian government. In 1996 he was in the U.S. but was arrested after Russian authorities claimed he has embezzled $8 million from the Russian Exchange Bank, the Independent reported. However, the U.S. gave him political asylum after several FBI agents testified that the Russian mafia had put a contract on Konanykhin. Several years later, his asylum was revoked, but he was not deported. A U.S. district judge cancelled his deportation, saying that returning Konanykhin to Moscow \u201c stinks .\u201d After placing a bounty on Putin, Konanykhin was asked if he feared that Putin would come after him for putting a bounty on his head. \u201cPutin is known to murder his opponents,\u201d he said, Business Insider reported. \u201cHe has millions of them now.\u201d ABOUT THE AUTHOR Abby Liebing , Associate Abby Liebing is a Hillsdale College graduate with a degree in history.

Category: International Politics Tagged with: Constitution deportation explosion Facebook Facebook post FBI murder picture Russia Ukraine Vladimir Putin War Christians, Let\u2019s Spend More Time in Prayer Than on\u00a0Twitter REPORTED BY: ELLE REYNOLDS | MARCH 02, 2022 Read more at https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/02/christians-lets-spend-more-time-in-prayer-than-on-twitter/ There\u2019s a lot of panicked chatter about World War III lately. Twitter is awash in propaganda from both sides of the Russia-Ukraine border. Instagram is flooded with pro-Ukraine posts and profiles are painted with the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag. NPR wants to make sure you know, amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, how to self-care . Not to be outdone, Fox also has a primer on how to cope with the stress of news of war. Many of those reactions aren\u2019t bad. It\u2019s good to celebrate stories of courage and to vocally support peace. It\u2019s also good at times to walk away from the news cycle and be present in your own daily responsibilities. But there is a real danger to thinking that you, as an American Christian who is not on the ground in Ukraine, can do the most good by getting sucked into the online informational meatgrinder. While there\u2019s certainly nothing wrong with using a post or a hashtag to show support for suffering people, it would be a mistake to use such a contribution to pat ourselves on the back for \u201chelping\u201d \u2014 as many well-meaning Christians posted black squares on Instagram in 2020 that did little but alleviate their own sense of wanting to be able to say they did something. We all have a human desire to be in the know, and to an extent, involved, when crisis strikes. It\u2019s why \u201cif it bleeds, it leads\u201d became a news industry saying and why people gossip. I\u2019ll be the first to admit I\u2019ve seen it in myself this week and felt convicted for it. Fellow Christians, have you spent as much time in prayer this week as you have refreshing headlines, sharing viral internet posts, or fretting to your friends about what\u2019s going on in Europe? It\u2019s worth considering. We are called, as the Apostle Paul writes in Ephesians 6:18 , to be \u201cpraying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints.\u201d In Romans , he entreats us to \u201cRejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.\u201d Specifically, we are commanded to pray for those in positions of worldly power. That isn\u2019t to say that, when presented with opportunities to tangibly serve, we should sit on our hands atop our prayer mats. The Bible has plenty to say about faith without works , or being hearers of the word and not doers . The clear-eyed actions of the church in Ukraine should remind us all to reach for our Bibles before our Twitter feeds. Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Greek Catholic Church, announced his plans to bring Mass to citizens huddled in bomb shelters. He was reportedly scheduled to attend a meeting of bishops in Florence but scrapped the trip to stay behind in Kyiv. \u201cThe church will come to the people,\u201d he said . \u201cOur priests will descend to the underground, they will descend to the bomb shelters, and there they will celebrate the Divine Liturgy.\u201d Other Ukrainian Christians are asking for, along with prayer, more Bibles. A defining truth of our faith is our security in salvation that does not come from this world, and our peace that is not attainable through geopolitics. We should seek to steward this earthly life in peace, but its lack should not cause our faith to founder. If Ukrainian Christians can stalwartly bear witness of their heavenly hope from bomb shelters, surely American Christians can do our shared faith the credit of not participating in panic. May our unchanging concentration on our Savior at a time that makes many anxious even be a testimony pointing to his sovereign grace. He has used times of crisis to His glory before. The second book of Kings recounts the siege of Jerusalem by Sennacherib, king of Assyria. In response to his taunts and saber-rattling, we\u2019re told, the people of Jerusalem, under the leadership of Hezekiah, \u201cwere silent and answered him not a word, for the king\u2019s command was, \u2018Do not answer him.\u2019\u201d Instead, Hezekiah went to the house of the Lord. The humble prayer he prayed before the Lord\u2019s deliverance remains a worthy template for our own prayers for the protection of the church, in Ukraine and elsewhere. O Lord, the God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth. Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God. Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, but the work of men\u2019s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed. So now, O Lord our God, save us, please, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Lord, are God alone.

Category: Political Tagged with: Christianity Prayer Religion Social Media Twitter Ukraine War Op-ed: Flynn Exposes Truth About Putin\u2019s Real Plan \u2013 Says It\u2019s Time to\u00a0Pray Commentary By Michael Flynn |\u00a0February 24, 2022 Read more at https://www.westernjournal.com/breaking-flynn-exposes-truth-putins-real-plan-says-time-pray/ With the price of oil pushing above $100 per barrel, the U.S. stock market opening with heavy losses, more global economic challenges looming, the real potential for significant loss of life, and the\u00a0international community in complete disarray with feeble attempts to condemn what was totally avoidable, we face the onset of another very grave and historic period of tension between competing ideologies and worse, the onset of WWIII. This \u201c invasion \u201d was totally avoidable. As one friend told me, President Joe Biden and his failed foreign policy team set the table and sent the invitation and Russian President Vladimir Putin came and spoiled the dinner party. Clearly, there are fault lines on both sides, but for now, we must pray that those affected, without the ability to decide their fate, are able to survive this extraordinary period of world history unfolding (for many, unraveling) on the world stage. Civilians and military forces will be killed, wounded and displaced; those are the real consequences of war. Pray that this conventional war is limited in scope, purpose and intent. Yes, there were gross violations of previous agreements due to incompetence, arrogance and ignorance that got us to this point. Beyond this, what happens next is anyone\u2019s guess, but Putin (and Xi \u2014 Taiwan?) just laid down a new world order marker. That said, it is doubtful that the U.S. administration will change its failed foreign policy, and instead, it will make weak attempts to triple down on leveraging this extremely serious situation in Europe to continue to distract from problems here at home. Given the shutting down of the Keystone pipeline and America\u2019s energy independence while also enabling Russia and Germany (read: Europe) to reopen the Nordstream pipeline, one has to wonder about the discussions in the Oval Office that came to these conclusions. This is the Biden administration: describing America as a systemically racist nation; appointing Marxists and other radical ideologues to positions of power; allowing millions to surge across our southern border; attempting to federalize our election systems and processes; implementing racist critical race theory in our schools, military and government; and all along, raising the national debt until it is closing in on $30 trillion \u2014 spending us toward extinction, all for left-wing causes. Let us not forget the Afghanistan disaster, the myriad lies about COVID, a certain Biden-owned laptop , a complete refusal to investigate allegations of election irregularities \u2026 all while China gets a pass. It is extremely difficult to trust this administration when they lie with a straight face to the American people daily. Anyone who questions these rotten foreign and domestic policies is demonized as a racist. We see the unleashing of the federal government on citizens who are simply exercising their\u00a0constitutional rights and the establishment media covers all this incompetence with a fake smile due to their own deep corruption. Our president rarely entertains questions or takes responsibility for his tone deafness and failures. The White House ignored \u2014 even laughed at \u2014 Putin\u2019s legitimate security concerns and ethnic unrest in the Ukraine. We have yet to hear from the president of the United States an explanation of U.S. national security interests in the region. Instead, we continue to demonize Russia \u2014 reminiscent of the fake Russia-collusion hysteria we now know was perpetrated against the Trump administration by elements of the Clinton campaign\u00a0 and Obama administration (among others). President Putin calculated this strategic, historic and geographic play and made the decision to move. And he did. All that given, there will never be justification for this invasion or any other form of invasion. However, never forget that war results when diplomacy fails . May God watch over and protect those in harm\u2019s way and may God continue to bless and protect the United States of America. Michael Flynn Retired Army Lt. Gen.

To top it all, President Obama\u2019s former Russia hand quite literally called for war against a nuclear rival to ensure the sovereignty of Ukraine, a proposition unthinkable during Cold War bipartisanship, when the first instinct was to ensure great power equilibrium and avoid mutually assured destruction. They are not the only ones. A recent New Yorker profile makes it clearer than any: Vladimir Putin presents himself to his citizens and to the world as the standard-bearer of a modern counter-enlightenment. He has declared liberal democracy \u2018obsolete,\u2019 a political arrangement that has \u2018outlived its purpose. One of his historical role models is said to be Alexander III, a reactionary tsar in the Romanov dynasty who instituted draconian restrictions on the press, sought to \u2018Russify\u2019 his multi-ethnic empire, and mobilized against internal and external threats. Four years ago, Putin expressed his deep admiration for the tsar while visiting the Crimean Peninsula, a substantial and distinctly unthreatening parcel of Ukraine that Russia invaded in 2014 and has occupied ever since. A Rabid Response to the New Right\u2019s Power There is a palpable panic at Carlson arguably driving the GOP towards a more pre-war conservatism. It\u2019s even being hysterically termed Putinism and \u201c Russia First \u201d by some commentators. Michael McFaul, Obama\u2019s Russia ambassador, was vocal on Twitter arguing that opposing Russia is a moral duty of anyone who opposes \u201cimperialism,\u201d alongside both prominent liberal theorists and second-tier neoconservative internationalist gadflies . There has also been relentless fearmongering about Carlson, authoritarianism, and nationalism. Some have gone so far as to bizarrely tag Carlson a \u201c comrade ,\u201d which is absurd because Putin\u2019s Russia is far more Christian and conservative than the increasingly secular West. \u201cWhy is it disloyal to side with Russia but loyal to side with Ukraine?\u201d Carlson asked, provoking commentary noting Putin murders dissidents. Yet the world is full of rulers who murderously abuse power\u2014for example, by sending drones that kill non-combatants and children. It cannot be a matter of American patriotism to send U.S. troops to die for evils in other nations, or United States must attempt to police the entire globe. Experience has shown that is practically impossible and deeply damaging to U.S. national interests. Thus in recent years, the ascendant New Right has led a bipartisan push for a more restrained foreign policy, one predicated on cutting down on foreign entanglements ( termed as foreign policy realism in academic circles ) especially from the Middle East, pushing Europe to spend a lot more for its own defense, and focusing more on domestic issues, as well as the rise of China. Carlson is perhaps the most prominent voice of that school in the right and has consistently opposed needless foreign confrontation, especially over Iran and Russia . Matt Walsh and Sohrab Ahmari recently also opposed further confrontation with Russia over ensuring democracy and rights in Ukraine, as this conflict does not directly threaten the American landmass or way of life. Prominent next-gen Republican lawmakers and foreign policy leaders, such as Adam Laxalt, Bernie Moreno, J. D. Vance, Blake Masters, and Peter Meijer also often voice more realist rhetoric. Is It America\u2019s Job to Change Other Nations\u2019 Regimes? This realignment has also included questioning whether the ascending conservative foreign-policy realism in America, based on a narrow definition of national interest, is compatible with progressivism. Progressivism, as John Mearsheimer noted, is by definition universalist, radical, and revolutionary. Mearsheimer wrote, \u201cbecause liberalism prizes the concept of inalienable or natural rights, committed liberals are deeply concerned about the rights of virtually every individual on the planet. This universalist logic creates a powerful incentive for liberal states to get involved in the affairs of countries that seriously violate their citizens\u2019 rights. To take this a step further, the best way to ensure that the rights of foreigners are not trampled is for them to live in a liberal democracy. This logic leads straight to an active policy of regime change, where the goal is to topple autocrats and put liberal democracies in their place.\u201d Consider the relentless number of tweets by a section of the commentariat about Western support for ensuring LGBT-favoring laws in Ukraine, and Mearsheimer sounds prescient. Whatever these people are, their constant revolutionary and internationalist rhetoric would make Leon Trotsky blush. Our Job Is to Govern Ourselves First Foreign policy realism, on the other hand, enacts a grand strategy based on amoral narrow national interest, one formulated by early American statesmen from George Washington to James Monroe to John Quincy Adams. If it ever comes back as an administrative principle, then it will become the domain solely of the right. The aversion against great powers and spheres of influence is an egalitarian instinct claiming all states are equal, regardless of any other variable. This instinct is by definition unnatural and revolutionary. It defies geography, aggregate power, history, and most importantly, narrow nationalism. Believing that \u201c History \u201d is progressive, and therefore acting on it to liberate everyone everywhere and promote rights and democracy, then becomes part of an inflated American national interest. The side that does not believe in nation-states or nationalism cannot by definition side with a narrow interpretation of national interest. It\u2019s Natural to Defend Yourself Carlson is increasingly influential because he sides with something very natural: a human urge to be a nationalist, and therefore opposed to a relentless and crusading global revolution, whether promoting a borderless Marxism or an equally borderless liberalism. The ascendant New Right believes in peace through strength, and a very narrow Jacksonian definition of nationalism, in which Europeans pay for their own security and Americans only come at the last moment if things go wrong. In this view, China is a far bigger threat to American prosperity and its land-mass than Russia or Iran will ever be, and defending porous American borders matters a lot more to Americans than Ukrainian borders. The other side, a duopoly of Never Trump neoconservatives and liberal-internationalists, wants to continue to allegedly ensure human rights across the globe while neglecting the way of life at home. It may be a noble goal, but ultimately it\u2019s one that the majority of Americans and an overwhelming number of conservatives are tired of after 30 years, thousands of lost lives, and trillions of dollars in deficits. The instinct for promoting a global revolution to promote LGBT rights, liberalism, and feminism is as radical an instinct as it can get, and that argument is increasingly opposed by a majority of Americans who simply don\u2019t care enough to spend blood and treasure in places they cannot spot on a map. Self-Government Means No Country Is Too Big to Fail When Rhodes and McFaul yell about defending human rights in Ukraine, and Carlson and others on the right remind everyone of American failures in pursuing such an unlimited global policy, it\u2019s important to rethink the priors and understand the re-alignment in foreign policy is complete. Powerful realist voices on the left such as Matthew Duss, Stephen Wertheim, Tulsi Gabbard, and Rep. Ro Khanna notwithstanding, it is becoming increasingly clear that true restrained foreign policy realism is connected to a very narrow form of nationalism, and that is fundamentally a reactionary and therefore conservative concept. Second, as I wrote recently , \u201cselling\u201d such foreign policy, even to a very instinctively nationalist electorate like America, means talking in a language that most people will get. Carlson (and Donald Trump, for that matter) connected with the normal crowd, arguing about the futility of sending their sons to die for Ukraine, Afghanistan, or Libya. That has more impact than a bunch of Foreign Affairs Snapshots. This recent debate on Ukraine, therefore, has brought forth troubling questions for those trying to sell oxymoronic \u201c progressive \u201d foreign policy realism, which took a hell of a beating in the last few weeks.

Category: Political Tagged with: conservatism Eastern Europe foreign intervention Foreign Policy FOREIGN WARS Globalism military intervention NATIONAL INTEREST Nationalism NEW RIGHT REALISM Russia Tucker Carlson Ukraine Vladimir Putin War Seventeen Burned Bodies Appear Near Border as Democrats Say We Don\u2019t Need a\u00a0Wall Reported\u00a0By Ben Marquis | January 10, 2019 at 4:25pm URL of the original posting site: https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/seventeen-burned-bodies-appear-near-border-democrats-say-dont-need-wall/ Burned Car | Ilya Andriyanov / Shutterstock (Ilya Andriyanov / Shutterstock) President Donald Trump delivered his first primetime Oval Office address on Tuesday night, where he explained how the situation on the porous southern border of the U.S. had reached a \u201ccrisis\u201d level in terms of humanitarian and national security needs, a crisis which necessitates the construction of a border wall in some areas as part of increased border security overall. Democrats and the media immediately set about disputing Trump\u2019s labeling of the border situation as a \u201c crisis ,\u201d part of their overtly biased effort to instantly \u201cfact-check\u201d every word or statistic uttered by the president in the brief speech, and \u2014 coincidentally? \u2014 all seemed to arrive at the same conclusion: There is no real crisis at the border, only a \u201cmanufactured crisis\u201d brought about purposefully by Trump\u2019s actions, or some such nonsense like that. Of course, to follow along with the media\u2019s bouncing ball on this one, everyone must ignore the fact that the same liberal media loudly trumpeted the \u201c crisis \u201d at the border in 2013 and 2014 \u2014 when they were supporting comprehensive immigration reform and amnesty for illegal immigrants \u2014 or their hollering about a \u201ccrisis\u201d on the border through much of 2017 and 2018 when Trump began to crack down on illegal border crossings and deportations ticked up. In truth, however, the only thing \u201c manufactured \u201d about all of this is the Democrats \u2018obstinate opposition to the president and their refusal to acknowledge the basic and undeniable facts of what is occurring on and around the porous and lightly defended southern border. Case in point, Reuters reported on Thursday that at least 20 dead bodies \u2014 17 of which had been badly burned \u2014 were discovered on Wednesday in the Mexican city of Ciudad Miguel Aleman, which is located a mere 56 miles across the Rio Grande River from the U.S. border city of McAllen, Texas, where President Trump visited with U.S. Border Patrol agents and other officials on Thursday. Mexican authorities are reportedly investigating what has all the appearances of a deadly battle between members of two rival gangs in the area, gangs that routinely play in a role in the illicit cross-border excursions that bring illegal aliens, criminals, drugs, weapons and even terrorists into this nation. The suspected gang-related massacre even drew a mention from Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador at his daily news conference on Thursday, and though he didn\u2019t offer up much in the way of specifics, he did say that security officials would provide more information at a later date or time. Reuters noted that according to one Mexican security official, five burned-out vehicles were also discovered along with the 20 dead bodies, though the outlet noted that a separate Mexican security official had reportedly counted as many as 21 dead bodies at the scene.\u00a0The grisly scene was located in the Tamaulipas region of Mexico, one of the more violent states in that nation that has been controlled by dangerous criminal cartels and gangs for years. Those groups exert a great deal of control over drug and human trafficking across the border in that region, and are well-known for running extortion rackets on local residents and exploiting migrants passing through the area for whatever can be gained. When not engaged in those border-related crimes, the cartels and gangs are fighting violently among each other or waging war against Mexican security forces, violence that has claimed tens of thousands of lives \u2014 some innocent, some not so much \u2014 over the years. Obviously, incidents like this one \u2014 and this bloody incident is far from an isolated occurrence \u2014 are what President Trump is referencing when he speaks of the \u201ccrisis\u201d at the border while demanding Congress appropriate the necessary funds to construct a border wall where needed and to increase border security measures in other ways. Yet, based solely on their reflexive opposition to all things Trump, many talking heads in the liberal media staunchly refuse to acknowledge as a \u201c crisis \u201d what their own colleagues are quietly reporting on a near-daily basis. Indeed, some in the media have even adopted a sort of \u201cDon\u2019t believe your lying eyes\u201d attitude when it comes to their anti-Trump reporting on the border, as evidenced by a ridiculous tweet from CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta that actually seemed to prove the president\u2019s point about how necessary and effective a border wall truly is. In several other tweets after that, Acosta hyped up how safe the border town of McAllen is \u2014 while studiously ignoring the obvious fact that McAllen is safe because it has a border wall and other barriers obstructing those who would illicitly cross over. Unfortunately, the wall and other barriers along the border in the McAllen region that keep it so safe only extend for so long, and eventually give way to mere chain-link fencing or nothing at all, meaning those who wish to cross the border illegally need only walk around the end to do so. Anyone with common sense and intellectual honesty can plainly see that and realize Trump is absolutely correct to want to address this security crisis post haste.

They can\u2019t tell the difference between a soldier and a child. Depending on the level of exposure, death can come after a few agonizing minutes. Those that do survive often live with neurological, physiological, and mental wounds for the rest of their life. It\u2019s no wonder this was a \u201c red line \u201d for former President Barack Obama in the Syrian Civil War. When chemical weapons were used, however, the United States of America was nowhere to be found. Obama\u2019s excuse? Chlorine gas, used in the attack, isn\u2019t a chemical weapon. \u201cChlorine itself has not been listed as a chemical weapon,\u201d the former president stated. Chemical weapon or not, chlorine gas isn\u2019t pretty. I won\u2019t list the effects here, but accounts from the First World War paint a grisly picture of chlorine\u2019s gruesome interaction with human skin, eyes, and organs. Let\u2019s give Obama a pass and let him play around with semantics. President Donald Trump operates by a different standard. Syria attempted to test Trump\u2019s red line with chemical weapons, possibly expecting the same response as Obama. Within a week , Trump had U.S. warships parked on the coast. A few missile salvos made his position on the matter painfully clear. Now, apparently not done with poking the sleeping giant, Syria has doubled down on chemical weapons. Syrian President Bashar Assad has given the green light for use of chlorine in what is expected to be the last true battle of the Syrian Civil War. Idlib province is the last remaining rebel holdout, and the target of Assad\u2019s chemical ambitions. The remaining rebels are a motley crew \u2014 the survivors include al-Qaeda allies and the Turkistan Islamic Party, an Islamic terrorist group that was founded in China.\u00a0Unfortunately, the area is also crawling with civilians. The province of Idlib had a population of 1.5 million in 2011, giving it roughly the same population as modern-day Hawaii. Although international treaties forbid use of force against civilian targets, the Syrian Civil War is already rife with humanitarian crimes. Trump leveled a stark warning against Assad, telling him to play fair \u2014 or else. \u201cIf it\u2019s a slaughter, the world is going to get very, very angry, and the United States is going to get very angry too,\u201d President Trump said. A new initiative approved by the Commander-in-Chief would see 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria indefinitely. The purpose is to ensure the total eradication of ISIS as well as the return of Iranian forces to their home country. The Middle East has ultimately been a quagmire for the United States military. Every insurgent force we fight is an expert in asymmetrical warfare, draining our economy while giving us no real gains. We have nothing to show in the almost 17 years we have spent engaged in Afghanistan. Our time in Iraq did unseat a dictator, but our exit gave ISIS a playground full of abandoned U.S. equipment. This doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore evil in the world. Trump was right to act once his red line had been violated. Assad knows to tread carefully now \u2014 the second lesson from the United States is sure to be more painful than the first. As for the best Syria policy? Donald Trump himself hinted at it in 2013. If they want a war, we\u2019re always ready to give them one. But let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Jared Harris Editor Jared is a husband, dad, and aspiring farmer.

Category: Political Tagged with: Barack Obama Bashar al-Assad Donald Trump Fight ISIS MIddle East Military Syria United States of America War Interactive Nuke Map: Would You Survive a Direct Hit to Your\u00a0City? Reported By Martin Walsh | January 24, 2018 at 11:53am URL of the original posting site: https://conservativetribune.com/interactive-nuke-map-survive/ While North Korea has frequently threatened to launch nuclear missiles at the United States, the U.S. has vowed to defend itself at all costs.\u00a0As such, many may not be aware of how powerful and deadly a nuclear attack would be if it ever occurred, especially on our own shores. The website NuclearSecrecy.com features an interactive nuclear map that allows viewers to visually see the effects certain nuclear attacks would have on an area. On the website, there\u2019s an interactive map of the United States.\u00a0A column on the right side of the page allows users to fill in certain information to visualize how deadly and powerful a nuclear attack would be.\u00a0Users can fill in a location and select a certain type of nuclear bomb, as well as other effects associated with the aftermath of a hypothetical attack.\u00a0After imputing the information in the three sections, the user clicks the \u201c detonate \u201d button. Then, a visualization tool will show the full effects of the explosion. For example, plugging in New York City, New York, \u201cNorth Korean Weapon tested in 2013 (10 kt),\u201d and \u201c casualties ,\u201d the interactive map indicates that an estimated\u00a0181,770 fatalities and\u00a0504,940 injuries could occur from the bomb.\u00a0It will also display the scope of the bomb in terms of how far it will expand, which provides a chilling inside look at how powerful nuclear weapons can be. While the interactive map is for fun and allows users to plug in a variety of information to see how forceful certain nuclear attacks would be, it provides a very interesting perspective on the importance of preventing the use of such devastating devices. If a nuclear bomb North Korea tested in 2013 can kill nearly 200,000 people, imagine what they may be capable of launching today.\u00a0This underscores why President Donald Trump has taken a tough approach with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, who has advanced the rogue regime\u2019s nuclear capabilities for years. Trump has made it clear that while the U.S. wants to avoid a conflict, we are determined to remain the most powerful nation in the world. Our president has promised to rain down \u201c fire and fury \u201d against North Korea and has vowed to protect the U.S. at all costs. This has come as North Korea has issued several threats to attack the U.S. and our Pacific territory of Guam. After months of North Korean missile launches and Kim Jong Un\u2019s promises to destroy the United States, Trump has made it clear to North Korea that he will protect the U.S. and its allies. Hopefully the interactive nuclear map will inform people just how devestating a nuclear attack would be if it were to ever hit the United States, and liberals will finally understand why Trump is doing everything he can to put \u201cRocket Man\u201d in his place and ensure the U.S. will always be protected.

Category: International Politics Tagged with: North Korea Nuclear Power War Not Done After Slaying 8 Terrorists, Marine Grabs Bad Guy\u2019s Gun, Makes\u00a0History Reported By Davis | on September 14, 2017 at 11:10am URL of the original posting site: https://conservativetribune.com/marine-grabs-gun/? Advertisement \u2013 story continues below https://tpc.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-10/html/container.html#eid=21060375 Countless awe-inspiring stories of courage and sacrifice have come out of the wars wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. One such story involved then-Cpl. Clifford Wooldridge, a Marine who was stationed in Afghanistan . Wooldridge was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions in combat, Business Insider reported. When Wooldridge\u2019s patrol came under fire from Taliban forces in Afghanistan in 2010, he was instrumental in helping to win the battle. His actions sound like something straight out of a \u201c Rambo \u201d movie. \u201cCorporal Wooldridge led one of his fire teams across open ground to flank the enemy, killing or wounding at least eight and forcing the rest to scatter. As he held security alone to cover his fire team\u2019s withdrawal, he heard voices from behind an adjacent wall,\u201d the citation for his Navy Cross read. Wooldridge rushed around the corner, killed two more fighters with his M-249 weapon, and that\u2019s when things got interesting. \u201cAs he crouched back behind the wall to reload, he saw the barrel of an enemy machine gun appear from around the wall. Without hesitation, he dropped his empty weapon and seized the machine gun barrel,\u201d the citation recounted. \u201cHe overwhelmed the enemy fighter in hand-to-hand combat, killing him with several blows to the head with the enemy\u2019s own machine gun.\u201d This guy literally beat a terrorist to death with the terrorist\u2019s own weapon. That has got to be something for the history books. USA Today reported that by monitoring Tablian chatter after the attack, the Marines heard them expressing sheer terror over what Wooldridge had done. \u201cIt absolutely crushed their morale,\u201d explained Wooldridge\u2019s platoon commander, Marine Capt. Patrick Madden. \u201cThey had no idea what happened to them.\u201d Wooldridge received his Navy Cross in 2012. The Marine Corps Times noted that Wooldridge left the Marine Corps in 2016. What an amazing story of bravery. Any terrorist out there should know that there are thousands of Americans like Wooldridge who will do whatever it takes to defend their country and their comrades.

Advertisement \u2013 story continues below Tensions between the United States and North Korea have been dramatically increasing for the past few weeks, with North Korea routinely threatening a nuclear attack on the United States. The Pyongyang regime\u2019s most recent threat is one of its most disturbing to date. North Korea\u2019s state-run media claimed the country could kill millions of Americans by detonating an electro-magnetic pulse in the upper atmosphere over the United States, Fox News reported this week In its most basic terms, an EMP is a burst of energy that wipes out almost all electronic devices. Cell phones, car batteries, power stations, pretty much anything that runs on electricity, would be permanently fried, or at the very least severely damaged. North Korea could achieve this by detonating a hydrogen bomb in the atmosphere. Nuclear explosions result in EMPs, and the EMP from a high-atitltude burst of a nuclear weapon would be devastating to the United States. \u201cThe biggest danger would be shorting out of the power grid, especially on the East Coast. Imagine a situation where large sections of the U.S. had no power. Imagine New York or Washington, D.C., with no power for just a week. The implications would be hard to fathom,\u201d Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest. \u201cThe casualty rates would be off the charts,\u201d he added. While it sounds like something from science fiction, the threat is very real. After an EMP burst, there would be no electricity on the power grid, which would mean no running water, no hospitals, no heat (or air conditioning depending on where you are) and no transportation. Essentially we would be back in the 19th century age for months, maybe even years. \u201cThat in it of itself is going to kill thousands if not millions depending on the size of it and where it is dropped. Also, nuclear weapons carry radioactive fallout that would be spread thousands of miles through the atmosphere and oceans,\u201d Kazianis explained. The government has long known about this threat, but very little has apparently been done about it. While it is unlikely that North Korea could actually pull something like this off, we should never discount the possibility. North Korea has surprised us with their capabilities before. With millions of lives at stake, the government needs to be acting to stop this threat from ever becoming a reality.

Category: International Politics Tagged with: Donald Trump Kim Jong Un North Korea Trump Administration War Sub Activity Days After ICBM Test Is\u00a0Frightening Reported By Benjamin Arie | August 1, 2017 at 8:59am URL of the original posting site: http://conservativetribune.com/north-korea-sub-exercises/ Advertisement \u2013 story continues below North Korea seems intent on provoking the United States\u2026 and their latest exercise has definitely gained our attention.\u00a0Just days after another long-range missile test, the communist nation has conducted what the Pentagon is calling \u201chighly unusual and unprecedented levels\u201d of submarine activity. According to CNN , that activity goes beyond routine sea maneuvers, and likely involves an \u201cejection test.\u201d As the name implies, the test is related to launching missiles from submarines hidden underwater, and suggests that the rogue country could be closer to having ICBM submarines than observers previously believed. While North Korea\u2019s missile capabilities have been largely mocked by the West, the reclusive nation seems to have made significant advances in the past year \u2014 and its military abilities are no longer a laughing matter. \u201cCoupled with reports of increased submarine activity, news of another ejection test comes amid concerns over North Korea\u2019s launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile that appears to have the range to hit major US cities on Friday,\u201d CNN explained. Advertisement \u2013 story continues below \u201cExperts believe if Friday\u2019s test had been fired on a flatter, standard trajectory, it could have threatened cities like Los Angeles, Denver and Chicago,\u201d continued the report. The combination of submarine launch testing and long-range ICBM demonstrations means that North Korea may be able to strike key Western targets in the near future. While the small nation\u2019s submarines are nowhere near as advanced as the United States\u2019 vessels, even a basic diesel-electric submarine can be difficult to detect. This means that a lone sub could possibly move closer to a target and leave precious little reaction time available in the event of a missile launch. President Donald Trump assured reporters that the U.S. is taking the North Korean threat seriously, but didn\u2019t reveal the specifics of a strategy. \u201cWe will handle North Korea. We are gonna be able to handle them,\u201d the president stated. White House spokesperson\u00a0Sarah Huckabee Sanders clarified that \u201call options are on the table\u201d in terms of an American response. Underestimating an enemy is never wise. Trump and the United States as a whole needs to address North Korea soon, before saber rattling turns to saber swinging.

ABC News reported that the Russian Defense Ministry warned Monday that it would now treat U.S.-led coalition jets flying west of the Euphrates River in Syria as targets after a U.S. Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian fighter jet that had dropped bombs on Syrian rebel forces Sunday. \u201c( I)t\u00a0it stopped short of saying it would shoot any down,\u201d Reuters reported. According to Sputnik News , the ministry warned that Russian missile defense \u201cwould intercept any aircraft in the area of operations of the Russian Aerospace Forces in Syria.\u201d \u201cIn areas where Russian aviation is conducting combat missions in the Syrian skies, any flying objects, including jets and unmanned aerial vehicles of the international coalition discovered west of the Euphrates River will be followed by Russian air and ground defenses as air targets,\u201d the ministry announced. Additionally, Russia claimed the U.S. did\u00a0not use the de-confliction hotline to warn them before the downing of the jet. In the statement, the ministry said it\u00a0would no longer participate in the de-confliction hotline. Reuters reported that U.S. military officials confirmed\u00a0that a US F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet had shot down a Syrian SU-22 aircraft after the Syrian jet reportedly dropped bombs near fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is backed by the U.S. The SDF is an alliance of Kurdish and Arab soldiers fighting Islamic State group terrorists in Raqqa.

This is the first incident between U.S. warplanes and Syria\u2019s air force since the country\u2019s civil war began six years ago. If Putin decides to follow through on these threats, he may learn the hard way that the Trump administration\u2019s red lines are less flexible than those of former President Barack Obama.

Category: International Politics Tagged with: Russia Syria Vladimir Putin War World War III THAAD Missile Set Up in North Korea Is Officially Ready to\u00a0Use Reported By Martin Lioll | May 2, 2017 at 5:44am Advertisement \u2013 story continues below URL of the original posting site: http://conservativetribune.com/us-officials-news-border-advantage/ A missile defense system that the United States has begun installing in South Korea has \u201creached an initial operating capability to defend against North Korean missiles,\u201d according to news reports. U.S. officials confirmed Monday that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, which was deployed to the Korean peninsula in order to counter the threat of missile strikes from Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime, had successfully come online, according to Reuters . However, they cautioned that full operability would not be reached for several months. The system\u2019s installation has been a point of contention with China, which has argued that THAAD\u2019s radar could be used to spy on Beijing and would weaken the deterrent effect of China\u2019s own ballistic missiles. \u201cIt helps in no way to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula and regional peace and stability,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said last week, according to Agence France-Presse . He added Beijing would \u201c take necessary measures to safeguard its own interests .\u201d On Tuesday, North Korean officials said that the introduction of the THAAD system , in addition to American bomber drills with Japan and South Korea, had pushed the peninsula to \u201c the brink of nuclear war .\u201d According to Reuters , North Korea state news agency KCNA reported that the bomber flights\u00a0were \u201ca nuclear bomb-dropping drill against major objects\u201d in North Korea. It\u00a0also said that President Donald Trump and \u201cother U.S. warmongers are crying out for making a preemptive nuclear strike.\u201d Yes, apparently we\u2019re the warmongers, even as North Korea conducts illegal missile tests and broadcasts concerts with video of San Francisco being blown up by a nuclear weapon . It\u2019s obvious that Kim Jong In is not tethered to reality. Dictators living in la-la land are hardly anything new, but most of them don\u2019t have nuclear weapons at their disposal. Thankfully, we have the THAAD to intercept any missiles from Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime, meaning whatever advantage he had is not what it used to be.

Category: International Politics , Military Tagged with: China Donald Trump North Korea Nuclear Weapons South Korea Trump Administration War Breaking: China Issues New Orders at NK Border, They Know We\u2019re\u00a0Coming Reported By Ben Marquis | on May 1, 2017 at 3:38pm URL of the original posting site: http://conservativetribune.com/china-issues-new-orders-nk-border/ Advertisement \u2013 story continues below As tensions continue to mount on the Korean peninsula and in the surrounding east-Asian region, China appeared to make further preparations for what increasingly looked like an impending humanitarian crisis. According to The Korea Times , a Chinese government document was recently spotted in the border town of Dandong ordering the \u201curgent\u201d recruitment of individuals fluent in both Chinese and Korean. Though the document didn\u2019t specify the number of Chinese-Korean interpreters to be recruited, it did mention 10 separate departments for which the interpreters could conceivably work, including departments dealing with border security, public safety, customs, trade and medical quarantine. Radio Free Asia reported on the document as well, and while it noted that a Chinese foreign affairs spokesperson dismissed the urgent request for interpreters as \u201c normal working requirements ,\u201d they couldn\u2019t help but point out that the order came at a time of drastically increased tension and fear that military action against North Korea could result in a flood of refugees surging across the border into China. \u201cSecurity and stability are very fragile at the moment, and the danger is great of a new conflict breaking out at any time,\u201d Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a recent news conference. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk even a 1\u00a0percent possibility of war.\u201d Such a conflict would have \u201cunimaginable consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, we call on all sides to be prudent and refrain from any actions or words that could lead to new provocations.\u201d A journalist for The Toronto Globe and Mail who has been at the Chinese-North Korean border for a time also noted the document in an in-depth report on the tension that has settled over the entire region. \u201cPeople living here have a deep sense of fatigue,\u201d explained Jin Qiangyi, director of the Centre for North and South Korea Studies at Yanbian University in China\u2019s northeastern city of Yanji. The people \u201care growing tired of it\u00a0all,\u201d the professor\u00a0explained. \u201cThe current state of things is more tense than it has ever been in the past.\u201d The reporter also noted other cities and towns placing themselves on \u201c high alert \u201d status and an abundance of military vehicles and troops staged throughout the area. He further noted that a failed nuclear test or similar catastrophe would likely send a cloud of radioactive contamination across the border into China, and that any sort of military strike or subsequent political unrest could prompt waves of refugees in the hundreds of thousands to try and flee the communist prison regime. While the urgent request for Chinese-Korean interpreters could very well be nothing more than normal procedure as Chinese officials claimed, odds are great that they are actually in preparation for a military strike that may be forthcoming in the near future, particularly if rogue dictator Kim Jong Un insists on testing a nuclear device in spite of United Nations resolutions prohibiting him from doing so and a near-unanimous international alliance warning him explicitly not to.

Category: International Politics Tagged with: China Military North Korea Nuclear Weapons refugees reporter South Korea War North Korea Warns of \u2018Super-Mighty Preemptive Strike\u2019 as US Plans Next\u00a0Move Posted by NEWSMAX.COM | Thursday, 20 Apr 2017 10:34 AM URL of the original posting site: http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Nkorea-strike-war-preemptive/2017/04/20/id/785350/ North Korean state media warned the United States of a \u201csuper-mighty preemptive strike\u201d after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States was looking at ways to bring pressure to bear on North Korea over its nuclear program. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a hard line with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has rebuffed admonitions from sole major ally China and proceeded with nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions. The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 Party, did not mince its words. \u201cIn the case of our super-mighty preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U.S. imperialists\u2019 invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.S. mainland and reduce them to ashes,\u201d it said. Reclusive North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no let-up in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing all the status of North Korea, both in terms of state sponsorship of terrorism as well as the other ways in which we can bring pressure on the regime in Pyongyang to re-engage with us, but re-engage with us on a different footing than past talks have been held,\u201d Tillerson told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, on a tour of Asian allies, has said repeatedly an \u201c era of strategic patience \u201d with North Korea is over. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said during a visit to London the military option must be part of the pressure brought to bear. \u201cAllowing this dictator to have that kind of power is not something that civilized nations can allow to happen,\u201d he said in reference to Kim. Ryan said he was encouraged by the results of efforts to work with China to reduce tension, but that it was unacceptable North Korea might be able to strike allies with nuclear weapons. North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. \u2018MAX THUNDER\u2019 South Korea\u2019s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, at a meeting with top officials on Thursday, repeatedly called for the military and security ministries to maintain vigilance. The defense ministry said U.S. and South Korean air forces were conducting an annual training exercise, codenamed Max Thunder, until April 28. North Korea routinely labels such exercises preparations for invasion. \u201cWe are conducting a practical and more intensive exercise than ever,\u201d South Korean pilot Colonel Lee Bum-chul told reporters. \u201cThrough this exercise, I am sure we can deter war and remove our enemy\u2019s intention to provoke us.\u201d South Korean presidential candidates clashed on Wednesday night in a debate over the planned deployment in South Korea of a U.S.-supplied Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system, which has angered China. Frontrunner Moon Jae-in was criticized for leaving his options open before the May 9 election. On Monday, Hwang and Pence reaffirmed their plans to go ahead with the THAAD, but the decision will be up to the next South Korean president. For its part, China says the system\u2019s powerful radar is a threat to its security. The North has said it has developed a missile that can strike the mainland United States, but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturizing a nuclear warhead. RUSSIA, US AT ODDS The United States and Russia clashed at the United Nations on Wednesday over a U.S.-drafted Security Council statement to condemn North Korea\u2019s latest failed ballistic missile test. Diplomats said China had agreed to the statement. Such statements by the 15-member council have to be agreed by consensus. Previous statements denouncing missile launches \u201c welcomed efforts by council members, as well as other states, to facilitate a peaceful and comprehensive solution through dialogue \u201c. The latest draft statement dropped \u201cthrough dialogue\u201d and Russia requested it be included again. \u201cWhen we requested to restore the agreed language that was of political importance and expressed commitment to continue to work on the draft \u2026 the U.S. delegation without providing any explanations canceled the work on the draft,\u201d the Russian U.N. mission said in a statement. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed in the Security Council maintaining unity. \u201cSpeaking with one voice is extremely important to the Security Council appropriately responding to the relevant issue on the peninsula,\u201d he told reporters. There has been some confusion over the whereabouts of a U.S. aircraft carrier group after Trump said last week he had sent an \u201c armada \u201d as a warning to North Korea, even as the ships were still far from Korean waters. The U.S. military\u2019s Pacific Command explained that the USS Carl Vinson strike group first had to complete a shorter-than-planned period of training with Australia. It was now heading for the Western Pacific as ordered, it said. China\u2019s influential Global Times newspaper, which is published by the People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s official paper, wondered whether the misdirection was deliberate. \u201cThe truth seems to be that the U.S. military and president jointly created fake news and it is without doubt a rare scandal in U.S. history, which will be bound to cripple Trump\u2019s and U.S. dignity,\u201d it said. \u00a9 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Category: International Politics Tagged with: Nkorea North Korea preemptive strike War The New Mexican\u00a0War Saturday, February 11, 2017 | The Diplomad \u201cThe Diplomad\u201d is a blog by career foreign service officers.\u00a0 Some very interesting stuff. URL of the original posting site: http://www.thediplomad.com/2017/02/the-new-mexican-war.html Much has been written, including in this blog, of the threat to America posed by radical Islamic terrorism. Not so much has been written about another threat, perhaps an even greater one. I refer to the threat posed by Mexico to the United States; it is multi-faceted and persistent, and forms a long established core component of Mexico\u2019s foreign policy. Before I get into the subject let me engage in the usual disclaimer required in our snowflake culture. I have been in Mexico many times both on vacation and for work as a US diplomat. I know Mexico well, am fascinated by its history, and consider Mexico City one of the great cities in the world. If you want outstanding restaurants and, above all, world class museums and other cultural institutions, go to Mexico City That said, I also have long considered Mexico a major threat to America. I have dealt with Mexican diplomats at the UN, the OAS, and in Central and South America. They are first rate. They are patriotic, well-trained, dedicated, and hard working. They, almost to a man and a woman, are also possessed with a deep, deep animus towards the United States. At the UN and the OAS, for example, Mexico, in my experience, played the role of opponent to whatever we sought to do. They not only consistently voted against us, they collaborated with our opponents on resolutions and projects antithetical to our interests, and, for example, refused to oppose Cuban and Venezuelan human rights violations. They rarely passed on an opportunity to stick it in our eye. Mexico had a major role in fostering guerrilla groups in Central America during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, backing off only when it became a hindrance to the NAFTA deal with the United States, and when some of the groups began operating in Mexico. Mexico is feared and resented throughout Central America as a bully and for its mistreatment of Central American migrants. The horror stories these migrants tell of their passage through Mexico are hair-raising and heartbreaking. I wrote during the recent hysteria over Russian hacking and interference in our\u00a02016 elections that , Is there foreign interference in our elections?\u00a0 You bet. The biggest offender? Not Russia, but Mexico .\u00a0 Mexican officials publicly called on Mexicans in the US to oppose Trump; Mexico\u2019s over fifty\u2013yes, fifty\u2013consulates in the US ( here ) are hot beds of political activity and activism .\u00a0 Millions of illegal and legal aliens largely from Mexico and Central America vote, yes vote. We need to have an in-depth investigation into Mexico\u2019s interference in our elections, an interference that goes well beyond revealing embarrassing DNC texts. There.\u00a0 That\u2019s an investigation the GOP should endorse, and the new Sec State should take up the issue of Mexican interference in our elections. That interference in our politics has not ceased since the elections. It, in fact, has increased. Some years ago, I mentioned to a senior colleague in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs at State, my concern over the openly political activity engaged in by Mexico\u2019s consulates and diplomatic personnel in the U.S. She acknowledged it was a problem but not one anybody wanted to take up. Well, it is now at a stage when it must be taken up. If the Trump administration is serious about protecting our borders and sovereignty the time has come for tough action on Mexico. We see this story in the Wall Street Journal (and here )\u00a0in which Mexican officials, including their diplomats in the US, are seeking to \u201cjam\u201d US courts with contested deportations. The Mexican government has set aside millions of dollars to help illegal Mexican migrants in the US fight efforts to deport them. In addition, Mexico, apparently, is contemplating the grotesque tactic of demanding that we PROVE that deportees are Mexican citizens before Mexico will accept them. In other words, we have to provide the documentation that Mexico failed to provide its own citizens. Mexican officials are holding meetings in Arizona with US politicians warning them about the harm to US-Mexico relations if illegal aliens are deported or prevented from coming to the US. Mexican officials are openly encouraging activists to block deportations. I find this nothing short of outrageous, but, nevertheless, a clear manifestation of the hostility that has long existed in Mexican officialdom for the USA. We must not only defend our border but, in my view, it is well past the time for the US to begin shutting down most of these Mexican consulates. There is no justification for Mexico to have over fifty consulates in the US. Had I the power, we would give Mexico one week to close 25-30 consulates. In addition, we would work out a plan to close additional consulates depending on how Mexico behaves. If Mexico, in fact, refuses to take back deportees, then we would need to take additional actions such as shutting down our visa issuance in Mexico, kicking out their ambassador from Washington, closing down the border crossing for periods of time, and even halting remittances to Mexico\u2013just to let Mexico feel the pain. As part, of course, of any comprehensive reform of our immigration laws, no federal money should go to supporting illegal aliens in the US. The Southwest USA does not \u201cbelong\u201d to Mexico. Mexico, please note, held California for about 25 years; they had Texas for even less time. Spain held the area for a couple hundred years, and we\u2019ve had it for some 170 years So enough with that argument. It is tiresome. The USA has the right to defend its sovereignty and borders. Mexicans have no right of access to the US any more than anybody else does. Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Pocket LinkedIn Tumblr Like Loading... Category: International Politics , Political Tagged with: Mexico United States of America War Veterans Day: The American Devotion to Military\u00a0Service by Jarrett Stepman 11 Nov 2015 URL of the original posting site: http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/11/veterans-day-the-american-devotion-to-military-service Getty Images It is a long-term and striking characteristic of the American people to show particular devotion to their soldiers and veterans. The famed French observer of American life, Alexis de Tocqueville , understood in the 1830s how the people of a participatory republic like the United States would be both fierce in war and show an uncommon fidelity\u00a0to those who had served in the military. Tocqueville described the conditions which would draw Americans into war, certainly applicable to World War I : \u201cWhen war has at length, by its long continuance, roused the whole community from their peaceful occupations, and ruined their minor undertakings, the same passions which made them attach so much importance to the maintenance of peace will be turned to arms\u2026\u201d Historian Erick L. McKitrick described Tocqueville\u2019s observation of the kind of patriotism that would become a hallmark of the American republic in relation to an \u201cAustrian peasant of 1914 being conscripted into the imperial army \u201d: \u201cThe powers above\u201d he might have said, \u201ctell me that I must go and do my duty; therefore, of course, I must.\u201d This is the tradition of authority, acceptance, and obedience. The same tradition can also be one of revolution and mutiny: there is something removed from the community scene, yet something focused and personified in the heads of the state, that can specifically be resisted\u2026 Yet in our own military tradition, such as it is, there are no such themes, either of implicit acquiescence or revolt. The conviction that our military enterprises are just and righteous does not flow automatically from on high\u2026 Where do the convictions of the righteousness of American soldiers and the justice or their cause emanate from? \u201c\u2026They emanate, in a special sense, from ourselves. Nobody, for instance, wants very much to be drafted for military service, but the sanctions are hard to \u2018mutiny\u2019 against; they come not so much from the President as from a \u2018local board composed of your neighbors.\u2019\u201d In keeping with the American tradition of venerating those who serve, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed November 11 as the first Armistice Day specifically to commemorate those who had fought in the First World War. The date holds special significance because it marked the end of hostilities in the \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918. The poor treatment of returning veterans after the Vietnam War was an outlier to this long-term trend and was a product of the culture war that divided Americans at that time and still does today. However, Americans have mostly doubled down in their devotion to returning veterans since that time, as there are now more generations who have returned home from fighting on our behalf. There is a common perception that America is becoming more self-obsessed and narcissistic, unable to care about or comprehend such notions as duty or devotion to country. While this is often sadly the case, there is another side to this country that hasn\u2019t lost these defining features. I recently visited the World War II monument in Washington, DC, which is an appropriate and profound tribute to the generation that fought and won the greatest conflict in world history. Though I came to pay my respects, I was enraged at the large number of tourists who treated the memorial as if it were nothing more than a park for personal amusement. Selfie sticks abounded, and a number of people were wading in the central pool that clearly had a sign \u201cDo not put your feet in the water.\u201d This spectacle left me feeling despondent about the future of the country and ashamed about what past generations would think of the American people in the 21st century. However, my entire perception changed in an instant as a sudden stream of veterans arrived at the monument as part of the Honor Flight program. Though seeing these distinguished men and women was special, what was perhaps even more important was the sudden and impromptu outpouring of devotion from the ordinary Americans who witnessed their arrival. Gone were the selfie sticks, and in their place appeared handshakes and personal thanks for the veterans\u2019 service. On this Veterans Day, it should be the duty of every American who still believes in the principles that this country was founded upon\u2014and in the men and women who fought on its behalf\u2014to make some tribute or gesture of thanks. It was established as a custom and a sign of respect to those who have fought for our country to hold a brief moment of silence at 11:00 AM , a tradition that every American should uphold.

Category: Patriotic Tagged with: National Security Veteran's Day War Woodrow Wilson World War I WE, the Stupid Author Unknown The war started in the 7th century and lasted through the 17th. I would contend it never stopped but historically the facts below are correct.\u00a0This is why I choke when I hear someone say we will defeat or contain these Islamic terrorists in a few years or even 30 years as recently stated by Leon Panetta. If the latest batch of murders, beheadings, and killing of innocent Christians has shocked you, maybe you should read this compilation of historical facts about the hatred of Muslims WE, the stupid . . . This is all factually (and historically) correct \u2013 and verifiable: In 732 AD\u00a0the Muslim Army which was moving on Paris was defeated and turned back at Tours, France, by Charles Martell. In 1571 AD\u00a0the Muslim Army/ Navy was defeated by the Italians and Austrians as they tried to cross the Mediterranean to attack southern Europe in the Battle of Lapanto. In 1683 AD the Turkish Muslim Army, attacking Eastern Europe, was finally defeated in the Battle of Vienna by German and Polish Christian Armies. This war has been going on for\u00a01,400 years\u00a0and half of the politicians don\u2019t even know it.\u00a0If these battles had not been won we might be speaking Arabic and Christianity could be non-existent; Judaism certainly would be. In addition, let us not forget that Hitler was an admirer of Islam, and that the Mufti of Jerusalem was Hitler\u2019s guest in Berlin and raised Bosnian Muslim SS Divisions: the 13th and 21st Waffen SS Divisions who killed Jews, Russians, Gypsies, and any other \u201csubhuman\u2019s\u201d. Reflecting : A lot of Americans have become so insulated from reality that they imagine that America can suffer defeat without any inconvenience to themselves. Pause a moment, reflect back. These events are actual events from history. They really happened!\u00a0Do you remember? In 1968, Bobby Kennedy was shot and killed by a Muslim male. In 1972 at the Munich Olympics, athletes were kidnapped and massacred by Muslim males. In 1972 a Pan Am 747 was hijacked and eventually diverted to Cairo where a fuse was lit on final approach.\u00a0It was blown up shortly after landing by Muslim males. In 1973 a Pan Am 707 was destroyed in Rome, with 33 people killed, when it was attacked with grenades by Muslim males. In 1979, the US embassy in Iran was taken over by Muslim males. During the 1980\u2019s a number of Americans were kidnapped in Lebanon by Muslim males. In 1983, the US Marine barracks in Beirut was blown up by Muslim\u00a0males. In 1985, the cruise ship Achille Lauro was hijacked and a 70 year old American passenger was murdered and thrown overboard in his wheelchair by Muslim males. In 1985, TWA flight 847 was hijacked at Athens, and a US Navy diver trying to rescue passengers was murdered by Muslim males. In 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was bombed by Muslim males. In 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed the first time by Muslim males. In 1998, the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed by Muslim males. On 9/11/01, four airliners were hijacked; two were used as missiles to take down the World Trade Centers and of the remaining two, one crashed into the US Pentagon.\u00a0 The other was diverted and crashed by the passengers. Thousands of people were killed by Muslim males. In 2002, the United States fought a war in Afghanistan against Muslim males. In 2002, reporter Daniel Pearl was kidnapped and beheaded by\u2014you guessed it\u2014it was a Muslim male. (plus two other American journalists were just beheaded) In 2013, Boston Marathon Bombing\u00a0four innocent people including a child killed, 264 injured by Muslim males. No, I really don\u2019t see a pattern here to justify profiling, do you? So, to ensure we Americans never offend anyone, particularly fanatics intent on killing us, airport security screeners will no longer be allowed to profile certain people.\u00a0So, ask yourself, \u201cJust how stupid are we?\u201d ABSOLUTELY NO PROFILING! They must conduct random searches of 80-year-old women, little kids, airline pilots with proper identification, secret agents who are members of the President\u2019s security detail, 85-year old, Congressmen with metal hips, and Medal of Honor winner and former Governor Joe Foss\u00a0(and a retired Air Force Chief Master Sergeant with a cast on his leg) , but leave Muslim Males, alone lest they be guilty of profiling. Ask yourself \u201cJust how stupid are we?\u201d Have the American people completely lost their minds or just their Power of Reason? Let\u2019s share this with as many people as we can so that the Gloria Alreds\u2019 and other stupid attorneys, along with Federal Justices, that want to thwart common sense, feel ashamed of themselves \u2014 if they have any such sense. As the writer of the award winning story \u2018Forrest Gump\u2019 so aptly put it, \u2018Stupid Is As Stupid Does.\u2019 Each opportunity that you have to send this to a friend or media outlet\u2026 DO IT!

Shabazz made the call last week on \u201cBlack Power Radio,\u201d the official network for the New Black Panther Party. He\u2019s saying that black communities must be defended by armed blacks against police brutality. \u00a0He added, \u201cWe will defend ourselves as Malcolm said, \u2018by any means necessary,\u2019 and that the only option can not be non-violence,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have the right to defend ourselves with deadly force.\u201d In response, we\u2019d like to make two points. The first is that blacks have a Constitutional right to own and carry firearms and it\u2019s not Conservatives that are afraid of blacks exercising that right, it\u2019s the Progressives who are doing everything they can to keep blacks on the liberal plantation who are fighting them. The second is simple. \u00a0Given the way the black community is responding to police presence, it\u2019s time for the police to let them take care of their own. \u00a0Here\u2019s Baltimore Police Chief Anthony Batts . \u201cAt the same time, Mr. Batts said, violent crime in the Western District is \u201cdramatically\u201d outpacing other areas of the city, with 19 homicides and 51 shootings this year. He said officers answering calls there are routinely surrounded by hostile crowds \u2026\u201d The problem in the \u201cblack community\u201d in Baltimore isn\u2019t cops. \u00a0It\u2019s the \u201ccommunity.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s the lack of community. \u00a0It\u2019s the lack of a real culture. \u00a0When you praise something you get more of it. \u00a0The \u201cblack community\u201d celebrates thugs like Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, and while we still don\u2019t know what really happened to Freddie Gray in Baltimore, he was a convicted felon and a thug. \u00a0Baltimore cops may well have been out of line in their handling of him, we\u2019ll find out, and if they broke the law \u2013 and only if they broke the law \u2013 they should go to prison. Baltimore had 39 homicides in May and we\u2019ve got over a day to go. It\u2019s a safe bet all of them were black and none of them were killed by either police or a white shooter. We\u2019re pretty sure Baltimore is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better. \u00a0Cops know their police chief and their mayor don\u2019t have their backs so they\u2019re not about to put it all on the line. That means the thugs own the streets. You asked for it Baltimore, enjoy it. And don\u2019t try to export it to Phoenix, we\u2019re MUCH better armed and we won\u2019t hesitate to defend our homes and lives from thugs. \u00a0Try Chicago or New York City, they\u2019ve got equally stupid strict gun laws.

The Obama administration has officially conceded the military effort in Syria is not about attacking the Islamic State. It is about removing Bashar al-Assad from power .\u00a0 The new strategy formed by Obama\u2019s national security team ignores the fact al-Assad and the Syrian military represent the only tenable opposition to the Islamic State and other Islamist groups funded and trained by the United States and its partners, most notably Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey. Employing convoluted logic, the administration argues the \u201clong-running Syria problem is now compounded by the reality that to genuinely defeat ISIL, we need not only a defeat in Iraq but a defeat in Syria.\u201d ISIL, short for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, is the acronym the government uses for Da\u2019esh (al-Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham), or the Islamic State. The initial plan, described as \u201cIraq first,\u201d concentrated on attacking the Islamic State in northern Iraq where it defeated the U.S. trained and armed Iraqi army and captured a large amount of territory. The administration is reportedly jettisoning this strategy in favor of directly targeting the Syrian government. In addition to creating a no-fly zone along the border with Turkey, the administration is looking at vetting \u201cmoderate rebels.\u201d As noted by Infowars and others, radical Sunni Islamists dominate the proxy war against the Shia government in Damascus and the argument that moderate forces are involved to any significant degree is largely a public relations effort designed to mask the real character of the so-called opposition. The United States is also targeting Syria\u2019s oil infrastructure . In September, it attacked grain silos in Manbij that killed civilians, not IS fighters. Attacks in Aleppo, Deir al-Zor, Hasaka, Raqqa and Idlib have killed civilians, including children. According to Reuters , the United States takes reports of civilian casualties seriously and says it has a process to investigate each allegation. The new strategy will in fact strengthen the Islamic State, not weaken it as Obama claims. The war \u201cis even less tenable than it was before, as between attacks on ISIS, Nusra, and Islamic Front fighters, and now the Assad government, the US is fighting materially all of the combat forces inside Syria at the same time, even the ones that are aligned with their publicly-stated goals,\u201d notes Jason Ditz . Ben Rhodes , Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said the administration has \u201chad regular meetings that the President has joined with his national security team on this issue and Syria has been an important subject at those meetings. And I think the President wants to make sure that we\u2019re asking hard questions about what we\u2019re targeting in Syria, how we\u2019re able to degrade ISIL but also how we\u2019re supporting opposition and building them up as a counterweight to ISIL but also ultimately of course to the Assad regime.\u201d \u201cAssad has been the biggest magnet for extremism in Syria, and the President has made clear that Assad has lost all legitimacy to govern. Alongside our efforts to isolate and sanction the Assad regime, we are working with our allies to strengthen the moderate opposition,\u201d added Alistair Baskey, spokesman for the National Security Council. Left out of the discussion is the fact the United States and its partners created and exacerbated the situation in Syria and are responsible for the death of over 140,000 Syrians , the displacement of millions of others and the wholesale destruction of the Syrian economy. Syria\u2019s GDP has fallen more than 35 percent, while the local currency has lost 80 percent of its value.

Category: International Politics Tagged with: Islamic State remove from power stop Islamic State Syria War Ferguson Resident: \u2018We are Getting Prepared for\u00a0War\u2019 By CBS Radio, November 10, 2014 7:27 AM URL Of Original Posting Site: http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2014/11/10/ferguson-resident-we-are-getting-prepared-for-war/ FERGUSON, Mo. (CBS St. Louis/AP) \u2013 Ferguson is \u201cgetting prepared for war\u201d if a grand jury doesn\u2019t indict Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson told CBS News he has been meeting with students, gang members and ministers about what might happen following the grand jury decision that is expected to come down this month. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear. A lot of people are afraid of what could happen,\u201d Johnson explained. \u201c In the end, this is gonna be the community we have to live in.\u201d Ronardo Ward, 33, is one of those hoping to maintain peace in Ferguson if Wilson isn\u2019t indicted. \u201cWe are getting prepared for war,\u201d Ward told CBS News. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just crazy.\u201d Michael Johnson, 42, believes many young people will rail against the \u201csystem.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be a lot of angry young people that\u2019s pretty much not gonna listen to the system anymore,\u201d Michael Johnson said. \u201cWhy should they?\u201d Protests have been going on for months following Brown\u2019s death in August. \u201cThe destruction here symbolizes this community, and how fragile and crumbled things are here,\u201d Johnson told CBS News. Despite the potential violence, Johnson doesn\u2019t believe Ferguson is ready to explode if Wilson is not indicted. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as bad as people want to make it out to be, but I think there\u2019s some tough times ahead,\u201d Johnson stated. Activists asked last Wednesday for advance notice before prosecutors announce whether Wilson will face charges in the shooting death of Brown, saying they can help prevent widespread violence if they have 48 hours to prepare for protests. Members of the Don\u2019t Shoot Coalition said at a news conference that they want to \u201cde-escalate violence without de-escalating action\u201d once a grand jury decides whether to indict Wilson, who is white, for the Aug. 9 shooting of Brown, who was black. The coalition represents more than 50 organizations including union workers, clergy, anti-war activists and black empowerment groups . Its members are leaders of the protests that erupted across the region after Brown\u2019s death and have continued in the three months since. \u201cEveryone around the United States and much of the world is looking at St. Louis,\u201d said Michael McPhearson, executive director of Veterans for Peace. \u201cThere\u2019s much anticipation as to what happens next.\u201d Demonstrators on Wednesday criticized the use of tear gas, riot equipment and armored vehicles by county and local police in the early days of the protests. The heavy initial response led Gov. Jay Nixon to summon the National Guard and temporarily put the Missouri Highway Patrol in charge of Ferguson crowd control. Ed Magee, a spokesman for St. Louis County Attorney Bob McCulloch, who is overseeing the grand jury investigation, met with McPhearson and attorney Denise Lieberman earlier Wednesday and said the coalition\u2019s request for 48 hours\u2019 notice of a grand jury decision is \u201cbeing considered.\u201d The grand jury was expected to hear evidence in Brown\u2019s case until mid-November, but McCulloch said Tuesday night that its work could continue for several more weeks. Brown, 18, was unarmed when\u00a0Wilson encountered him walking in the street with a friend. A scuffle ensued and Brown was shot multiple times. Witness accounts of what happened varied, with some saying they saw Brown raise his hands as if in surrender. \u201cAfter the verdict, no matter what it is, people are going to pour into the street \u2014 either in celebration or in rage,\u201d said Montague Simmons, chairman of the Organization for Black Struggle. \u201cIt\u2019s in the best interest of the public, the police and elected officials who control the actions of the police to work together to protect the rights of people to engage in civil disobedience and expression of their First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly.\u201d Organizers have created 19 \u201crules of engagement\u201d they want police to follow, including calls to treat protesters as \u201ccitizens and not enemy combatants.\u201d County police Chief Jon Belmar earlier this week reiterated that police do not intend to impede peaceful dissent but said he wouldn\u2019t take anything off the table when asked about the use of tear gas and other tactics. \u201cI have a responsibility\u2026to make sure that everybody walks out of this on the other end,\u201d he said.

Some of the actors are a little too androgynous for my liking. However, the idea of several factors occurring concurrently is easy to grasp as the central idea of the movie plot. The more dangerous factors that come to the fore, the worse the problem\u2026in the movie\u2026the Storm. O.K., O.K. So what we\u2019re looking at is a perfect Storm of Failure. ISIS is running amok. Even our former (preceding ISIS) enemies in the Middle East are distancing themselves from these savages. They are getting worse and more atrocious every day. Obama has no idea who these sinister SOBs are. Obama has furnished all sorts of weapons to ISIS. Obama has given away all the gains our troops made in the Middle East and doesn\u2019t seem to realize what a screw-up he has made in Iraq. Obama has fired some of our most experienced and capable generals, just when we probably need them most. Obama surrounds himself with idiots\u2026perhaps because he cannot distinguish idiocy. Shrinks tell their patients not to worry whether they are nuts because if they are worried about being nuts they probably aren\u2019t\u2026because crazy people never know they are personally whacko. Maybe crazy people cannot recognize insanity in others any better than in themselves. Perhaps this is also true of idiots. Maybe the same is true of functional idiots. Voila! \u201cI like cake!\u201d Oooops. That\u2019s another story, which, if I told now, would make perfect sense in this context.. The media is oblivious to all this. Obama seems oblivious to all this. Obama\u2019s current press secretary is certainly oblivious to all this stuff. The Colts are down 2-0 and I was already depressed. Obama\u2019s favorite sound is the Muslim morning call to prayer. Obama has no idea about foreign policy. Obama seems incapable of understanding anything. Obama\u2019s medical and Harvard grades and records are hidden from our view. Ergo\u2026Obama may be a psychopathic functional idiot. We have no way of knowing. Both sets of records would reveal this\u2026or rule him out as a sociopathic idiot. Obama thinks he is a genius about everything. He appears to know nothing. (Not counting his favorite mantra about inheriting the \u201cterrorists from his predecessor\u201d.) We have no idea who Obama is. I\u2019m out of space\u2026but could go on for a long time. When these factors are considered (amidst myriad others) I think we are worse off than the guys in the movie. Put on a life vest\u2026or don\u2019t. It probably won\u2019t matter considering what may be coming. Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Pocket LinkedIn Tumblr Like Loading...

(Ahmed Jadallah/Reuters) By Loveday Morris September 22 at 6:23 PM BAGHDAD \u2014 The army base in Iraq\u2019s western Anbar province had been under siege by Islamic State militants for a week, so when a convoy of armored Humvees rolled up at the gate, the Iraqi soldiers at Camp Saqlawiyah believed saviors had arrived. But this was no rescue attempt. The vehicles were driven by militants on suicide missions, and within seconds on Sunday the base had become a bloody scene of multiple bombings. On Monday, a day after the attack , five survivors \u2014 including three officers \u2014 said that between 300 and 500 soldiers were missing and believed to be dead, kidnapped or in hiding. Army officials said the numbers were far lower, leading to accusations that they were concealing the true toll. If the survivors\u2019 accounts are correct, it would make Sunday the most disastrous day for the Iraqi army since several divisions collapsed in the wake of the Islamic State\u2019s capture of the northern city of Mosul amid its cross-country sweep in June. In any case, the chaotic incident has highlighted shortcomings in an army that the United States has spent billions of dollars training and equipping, and it has further undermined the force\u2019s reliability as a partner as President Obama expands airstrikes into provinces including Anbar. It has also heightened pressure on new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi , whose opponents have already seized on the incident to accuse him of a soft-handed approach to terrorists. While U.S. aircraft have carried out strikes in support of Iraqi forces in other recent clashes, there was no indication that any American airstrikes were made against these Islamic State attackers, other than unconfirmed reports from Iraqi officials. Accounts released Sunday and Monday by U.S. Central Command made no mention of the overrun Iraqi base. The lead-up to Sunday\u2019s crisis began a week ago, when the last road to Camp Saqlawiyah, just north of insurgent-controlled Fallujah, was cut by Islamic State militants. One of two tanks that were among the vehicles guarding the road left to refuel, and the militants took the opportunity to attack those that remained, said a 9th Division soldier who was present and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. The fall of the units protecting the supply route meant that the five battalions inside the base were completely besieged. \u201cThere were no reinforcements, no food supplies, no medicine, no water, and then our ammunition began to run out,\u201d said 1st Lt. Haider Majid, 28. \u201cWe called our leaders so many times. We called our commanders, we called members of parliament, but they just left us there to die.\u201d Soldiers said they sought help from Lt. Gen. Rashid Fleih, the head of Anbar Military Command. He told Iraq\u2019s al-Sumaria news on Monday that the troops on the base were just complaining because they were trapped and \u201cbored.\u201d Fleih said the army had delivered supplies while the base was under siege. But soldiers maintained that they received nothing, and thirst eventually forced them to dig a hole to dirty, salty water. \u201cEven if it was dangerous for helicopters, it was their duty to try to help us,\u201d Majid said. Survivors said they faced daily attacks during the week, including one using chlorine gas, a claim that was impossible to verify Monday. While some said colleagues had suffocated in the attack, Col. Ihab Hashem, the deputy commander of an 8th Division battalion, said canisters had fallen short of the base. Attackers in disguise The major assault came Sunday. Soldiers interviewed said army commanders had sent word via walkie-talkie that a rescue mission was on its way and had taken control of a nearby bridge. Shortly afterward, Iraqi army armored vehicles and military trucks arrived, and the men inside were dressed in the uniforms of Iraqi counterterrorism forces, the surviving soldiers said. \u201cWe thought this was the support we were promised was on the way,\u201d said Capt. Ahmed Hussein of the 8th Division. \u201cThe first three Humvees were ahead of the rest with some military trucks. We just let them in.\u201d One Humvee exploded in the middle of the camp. The two others drove to the perimeter and detonated. The rest of the Islamic State convoy was held back at the entrance, where the survivors said the militants carried out several more suicide bombings as they tried to break in. \u201cI gathered my soldiers and said: \u2018We are going to die anyway. Let\u2019s try to get out,\u2019\u2009\u201d Hussein said, adding that he and about 400 other soldiers escaped under heavy fire in a convoy. Others were left behind. Those who got away divided into three groups, eventually leaving their vehicles after some were hit by roadside bombs. They continued on foot, traversing nearly two miles of territory held by the Islamic State until they reached Camp Tariq, about four miles away. \u201cI was in the first group; there were about 150 soldiers in each,\u201d Hussein said. \u201cOnly about half of each group made it.\u201d The rescue mission that the soldiers had been told was coming \u201c100 percent failed,\u201d he said. On the bridge that they were told had been secured, they found the remnants of that mission: burned army vehicles. \u201cNo one knows how many people died,\u201d said the 9th Division soldier, who spent days stranded in a house with 60 other soldiers. \u201cWe kept moving and never looked behind. Those who died, died. Those who were captured, were captured. We just ran for our lives.\u201d Hussein estimated that 250 soldiers died at Camp Saqlawiyah, and 100 to 150 are missing. Hashem put the number of dead and missing at 400 to 500. But there were hopes that some might still make it back. A group of 13 has been in contact, according to Hashem, to say they are hiding in marshlands, another 13 in a grove of trees. He advised them to wait until the cover of night to try to make the rest of the journey. Government\u2019s response The Iraqi Defense Ministry acknowledged Sunday that it had lost contact with some of its soldiers during the incident but did not say how many were missing. Fleih said that it was possible to \u201ccount them on one hand.\u201d \u201cIt looks like the Defense Ministry is trying to push the numbers down,\u201d said Mithal al-Alusi, a member of the Iraqi parliament\u2019s defense and security committee. \u201cIf we have lost people or not, this proves military structure and military strategy is not able to fight ISIS,\u201d he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. He added: \u201cMosul they said was a surprise \u2014 what\u2019s the excuse this time?\u201d Abadi, who also holds the position of commander in chief of the armed forces, issued a statement Monday saying army commanders would be interrogated on charges of negligence. The statement said the prime minister had ordered supplies to be delivered to the stranded soldiers four days ago. For some soldiers, the incident was the latest \u2014 and last \u2014 in a series of humiliations. Hussein, for his part, said he would leave the army to join a Shiite militia. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any leadership,\u201d he said. But for the militias, \u201ctheir leadership is with them in the field; they look after their soldiers.\u201d Mustafa Salim contributed to this report.

Category: Political Tagged with: Hamas Israel Terrorism War Hate speech from the pulpit: Chicago preacher calls for jihad against Israel\u00a0[VIDEO] http://allenbwest.com/2014/08/hate-speech-pulpit-chicago-preacher-calls-jihad-israel-video/ Written by Allen West on August 1, 2014 Just yesterday we shared the efforts of the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) to enlist the help of the IRS to crack down on churches. In case you missed it, \u201cthe Internal Revenue Service has settled a lawsuit brought by a secular activist group (FFRF), reportedly agreeing to adopt standards for determining and investigating whether churches and religious organizations have violated restrictions on political activity. The precise terms of the settlement are still unclear, as is how the IRS will amend its policies to enforce tax law on churches in a way that is palatable to the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF), which has long decried \u201crogue political churches.\u201d Well, I\u2019d like to submit to FFRF and the IRS a recommendation for determination and investigation about blatant \u201cpolitical activity\u201d emanating form a pulpit in Chicago (imagine that, Chicago). As reported by the Times of Israel , \u201cAn American Muslim preacher has been calling for jihad against Israel, amid the Jewish state\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza, in his weekly Friday sermons at a Chicago mosque.\u201d What is going on in Chicago? I mean Saul Alinsky, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Valerie Jarrett, David Axelrod, Rahm Emanuel, Louis Farrakhan, Jeremiah Wright, Jesse Jackson, Tony Rezko. And I assume FFRF and the IRS will probably reject my recommendation because, well, technically, it\u2019s not a church, it\u2019s a mosque \u2014 well, an Islamic center. And it wasn\u2019t on Sunday, but Friday, so I am quite sure FFRF will grant a waiver. I hope you\u2019ll take a few moments to watch this clip. In the video clip released on Thursday, Sheik Mohamed Elimam can be seen declaring that \u201cglobal Zionism is unadulterated evil besetting all people,\u201d and \u201cOh, those of you who want to wage jihad for the sake of Allah, Palestine is calling you and Gaza is crying out for your help,\u201d according to the translation by MEMRI, which posted the video. \u201cIf you are true believers, real mujahideen, hasten to Palestine.\u201d Elimam appeared to call for the removal of the Jewish state from the Middle East. Now, I just gotta tell ya, that sure does seem like \u201cpolitical activity\u201d to me \u2014 whaddya think? But not just political activity, this fella isn\u2019t delivering a sermon about saving anyone\u2019s soul \u2014 kinda like what I am used to. He\u2019s advocating killing souls. Now isn\u2019t that incitement to violence and a hate crime? Oops, forgot, this is the new \u201cprotected class\u201d \u2014 really mad Muslim jihadists and this Mullah or Imam are just exercising their First Amendment rights of free speech, freedom of religion, and the free exercise thereof. So will FFRF investigate this Imam? Methinks not, because they just want to wage their own little war against Christians. Furthermore, it would require them to have some courage to go after these guys \u2014 and you all know that is not happening. I presume FFRF will excuse this radical jihadist sermon and, yes, apologize and sympathize. Sheik Elimam is clear in his desires, but historically inaccurate, \u201cThis enemy was planted in the midst of the Arab nation, and they chose Jerusalem, Palestine, the most important area \u2013 in order to be a thorn in the side of the Arab and Islamic nations,\u201d he said. \u201cMay Allah pull this thorn out, and stick it down their [Western] throats. May they be sent back to their countries in shame and disgrace, Allah willing.\u201d I wonder what will be the topic of his sermon this Friday?

The difference between Hamas and Israel couldn\u2019t be greater, yet you wouldn\u2019t know it when listening to some observers. For the Non-Aligned Movement, it\u2019s all about Gaza\u2019s innocence and Israel\u2019s guilt. One fine day, with nothing else to do but consider how to provoke peaceful, serene Hamas-ruled Gaza, the big, bad Israelis decided to attack. For a fair share of the media, it\u2019s above all a story of Palestinian suffering at the hands of Israel\u2019s military machine. For the protesters in Frankfurt, Germany, on Saturday, it was about equating Israel to Nazi Germany. It\u2019s a perfect illustration of reverse causality. Hamas triggered a war, but that\u2019s long since forgotten, if ever it was remembered. The focus now is only on the suffering of those who are responsible for the conflict in the first place. Indeed, Goethe was right. There are those who can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, see what\u2019s right in front of them. Ideological blinders get in the way. Or a failure of imagination about the true nature of Hamas. Or a gullibility that allows people to believe whatever the Hamas propaganda machine churns out. Or, in some cases, downright hostility to anything that Israel, the Jewish state, does. It\u2019s high time for moral clarity, not moral fog. Hamas is a terrorist organization. That\u2019s its official designation by the United States, European Union, Australia, Canada and others. Israel is a democratic country with an independent judiciary, the rule of law, free and fair elections, and Click on image to see movie trailer and more a robust civil society. Hamas is anti-Western, anti-Christian (and, not surprisingly, anti-Semitic), anti-gay, misogynist and anti-intellectual. Israel is the exact opposite. Hamas has territorial ambitions on Israel. In fact, that\u2019s putting it too mildly: it would like to replace Israel in its entirety with a Muslim Brotherhood-ruled state. Israel has no territorial ambitions on Hamas-ruled Gaza. To the contrary, Israel left it totally nine years ago, with the hope of never having to return. Hamas has a vested interest in using its Gaza base for permanent confrontation with Israel. Israel, which, alas, can\u2019t change its geography, has a vested interest in a peaceful, moderate, and developing state on its border. Hamas, the sole ruler of Gaza since 2007, has used the last seven years to smuggle in weaponry and develop military punch, rather than building the foundation of a responsible state. Knowing this arsenal has been stockpiled for the sole purpose of being used against it, Israel seeks, as any nation would, to prevent Hamas from attaining its lethal goal. Hamas has no compunction about deploying terrorist cells and weapons in civilian population centers in Gaza, fully aware that Israel would have no choice but to appear to be targeting \u201cinnocent\u201d people. Israel goes to unprecedented lengths to avoid falling into the Hamas trap, even phoning and dropping leaflets in advance to warn civilians to leave target areas. Hamas cynically tells the civilian population to stay put, not to react to Israeli warnings about imminent strikes. The more Palestinian casualties, the better, as far as Hamas is concerned. Israel makes every effort to alert its entire population, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim, to Hamas missile strikes and move people into shelters as quickly as possible. Hamas uses mosques for storing arms. Israel uses houses of worship, including mosques, solely for prayer. Hamas uses schools for weapons depots. Israel uses schools solely to educate its children, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim. Hamas uses hospitals as terrorist redoubts. Israel uses its hospitals solely to cure the ill and injured, including residents of Gaza who can\u2019t find adequate care there. Hamas aspires to kill as many Israelis as possible, with rockets fired indiscriminately in all directions. Israel seeks out only the Hamas terrorist infrastructure, and has aborted many operations when the risks of civilian casualties were too great. Hamas, as the record amply shows, has no compunction about falsifying information, doctoring photos, staging scenes, and inflating numbers to make its case to the outside world. Israel, by contrast, goes to great lengths, even to the point of sometimes losing the edge in the \u201cmedia race,\u201d to verify information that it presents about its operations. Hamas supporters explode in paroxysms of glee when Israeli targets are hit. Israelis don\u2019t honk horns, shoot in the air, and pass out candy for doing what they wished they didn\u2019t have to do in the first place, and voice regret when the inevitable mistakes in warfare occur. Hamas wouldn\u2019t know how to spell the words \u201cinternational humanitarian law,\u201d much less adhere to it. Israel\u2019s defense forces have specialists in international humanitarian law assigned to every unit in an effort to ensure maximum compliance. Hamas shouts from the rooftops that Israel is a brutal enemy. Israel, unlike any other targeted nation in history, is actually providing \u2014 right now \u2014 up to 70 percent of Gaza\u2019s electricity and much of its fuel and foodstuffs, even as hundreds of rockets are fired from Gaza into Israel. Hamas celebrates death, something few Westerners can understand. Israel celebrates life, something all Westerners should understand.

Image: Barack Obama (Wiki Commons). House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa today issued a subpoena for Secretary of State John Kerry to testify before the committee on May 21 about Benghazi following the release of emails by Judicial Watch which show that the White House crafted a deceptive policy to falsely frame the attack as a spontaneous protest sparked by a YouTube video in order to protect Barack Obama\u2019s image. Lost in the haze of claims and counter claims is the real reason why the White House is desperate to prevent the attack from coming under any further scrutiny \u2013 because it would likely reveal an arms smuggling scandal that could rival Iran-Contra. In May last year , Senator Rand Paul was one of the first to speculate that the truth behind Benghazi was linked to an illicit arms smuggling program that saw weapons being trafficked to terrorists in Syria as part of the United States\u2019 proxy war against the Assad regime. \u201cI\u2019ve actually always suspected that, although I have no evidence, that maybe we were facilitating arms leaving Libya going through Turkey into Syria,\u201d Paul told CNN, adding that he \u201cnever\u2026.quite understood the cover-up \u2014 if it was intentional or incompetence\u201d. At the same time it emerged that the U.S. State Department had hired an Al-Qaeda offshoot organization , the February 17th Martyrs Brigade, to \u201cdefend\u201d the Benghazi Mission months before the attack. Senator Paul was vindicated less than three months later when it emerged that the CIA had been subjecting its operatives to monthly polygraph tests in an effort to keep a lid on details of the arms smuggling operation being leaked. On August 1, CNN reported that dozens of CIA agents were on the ground in Benghazi during the attack and that the polygraph tests were mandated in order to prevent operatives from talking to Congress or the media about a program that revolved around \u201csecretly helping to move surface-to-air missiles out of Libya, through Turkey, and into the hands of Syrian rebels.\u201d Although the Obama administration is now openly arming the Syrian rebels , it has been keen to stress that such weaponry has been restricted to so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d fighters, despite the fact that it is now widely acknowledged that Al-Qaeda is by far the most potent fighting force in Syria and indeed commands all the other militant groups. The real truth behind Benghazi is likely to reveal that the Obama administration knowingly and deliberately provided surface to air missiles and other weapons to the most bloodthirsty Al-Qaeda jihadists in Syria who are now busy crucifying Christians while promising to bring their reign of terror to the west. If a proper investigation into the Benghazi attacks uncovered concrete evidence of this arms smuggling scandal, Obama would face impeachment and many members of his administration would be facing long stretches in prison. That\u2019s the real reason why the White House is desperate to bury Benghazi. Paul Joseph Watson is the editor and writer for Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com .
