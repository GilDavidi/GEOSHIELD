What are storm surges?\nSurges are big, destructive waves powered by fierce winds. As hurricanes move across shallow areas of the ocean, significant changes in the water level can occur. The change in pressure can dislodge the water, creating a higher water level.\nBefore the eye of the storm hits, water levels may rise between one and two meters in low-lying areas. Water can flood the floors of buildings, trees can be pulled straight out of the ground, and sometimes structures or parts of a structure may collapse.\nPassengers who survive storm surges are often
