After all, the non-enforcement of Resolution 1701 at the end of the Second Lebanon War is what brought us to the current situation.\nEnforcement is the heart of the matter in the Lebanese arena. What enforcement measures are there and what are the sanctions for violations by Hezbollah?\n\n3. Israel was flying in the skies of Lebanon before the war, now it will have to commit that it will stop...\n\nThe bottom line, the proposal creates a situation where Israel will be left with just a paper in hand, without any deterrence and with Hezbollah's military force threatening the residents of the north.\n\nFor the Americans and the French this is excellent.
