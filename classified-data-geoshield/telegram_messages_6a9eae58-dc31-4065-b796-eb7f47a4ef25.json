Despite their efforts, the full version was posted on social media, revealing the truth.\n\nDr. Jodeh, covered in blood, arrived at Deir al-Balah's hospital after the rescue operation in Nuseirat. From the hospital, he condemned Hamas and labeled Palestinians \"a nation of cowards\" for not opposing them. Al-Jazeera edited out every single time Jodeh criticized Hamas, making it look like his criticism was toward Israel.\n\nAl-Jazeera also removed the unflattering ending of the original clip, showing a group of people trying to silence Dr. Jodeh once they realize he is speaking against Hamas at the presence of journalists. \n\nHere are the two videos: the full powerful version, and the edited and altered version Al-Jazeera presented to the Arab World (See cuts at 00:04, 00:13, 00:22).", "location": "GAZA", "classification": "antisemitism", "score": 0.5175970261904441, "event_breakdown": "The current events of antisemitism reported in text that can be placed on a map are:\n\n* Al-Jazeera caught altering video of Gazan criticizing Hamas amid ongoing bloodshed\n* Multiple rockets fired from Lebanon towards Israel; IDF retaliates with artillery fire"}]
