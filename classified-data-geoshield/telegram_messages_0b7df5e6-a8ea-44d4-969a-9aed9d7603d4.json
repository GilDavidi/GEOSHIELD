In my view, even in his previous role as the leader of Hamas in Gaza, Sinwar surpassed Haniyeh in skills and ambitions. Haniyeh was more of a symbolic leader than the actual \"President of Hamas.\" Sinwar has always been more dominant, sharper, more ambitious, saw further and aimed higher... perhaps too high. Sinwar believes that he can achieve things others think are imaginary or impossible - this is largely how, in collaboration with Mohammed Deif, the ambitious plan for the October 7th massacre was conceived. To implement such a plan, to think of it in the first place, one needs to be an extraordinary person, with sophisticated and exceptional thinking, great courage, insensitivity, and a certain degree of madness - all of which Sinwar possesses. Haniyeh, less so.\n\nLast night, I wrote that I think the move to appoint Sinwar as the head of Hamas's Political Bureau brings us one step closer to ending the war. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, one of the main goals of this move, in my view, is to relieve the pressure on Qatar. The Americans exerted significant pressure on the Qataris, who host the Hamas leadership abroad, to pressure Hamas into agreeing to a hostage deal. This current move neutralizes the American pressure on Qatar - the decision-making center has now entirely shifted to the Gaza Strip. This also eliminates the need for \"back and forth\" on important decisions regarding the war between Hamas leaders abroad and those inside the Gaza Strip. \n\nThe Gaza chapter of Hamas is now making the decisions, and the \"full responsibility\" lies on its shoulders. Effectively, Yahya Sinwar is the Gaza chapter, and he is now responsible for managing the war. To a large extent, the \"keys to ending the war\" lie within a small area, easily accessible to Israel and under constant physical Israeli pressure.\n\nIn my opinion, Hamas has taken an \"all in\" approach regarding the war and what is happening in Gaza, while isolating the territory (of the Gaza Strip). Gaza's fate is now in its own hands. I am convinced that Hamas leaders considered the realistic possibility of Yahya Sinwar being eliminated in Gaza when they unanimously decided to appoint him. \n\nPerhaps, in their eyes, such an event could allow them to embark on a new path, retreating from positions Hamas is currently stuck in. Positions that do not allow for the end of the fighting.\n\nThis could close the chapter of October 7th, a product of the Gaza Strip designed by Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, and could end in Gaza when those who conceived it meet their fate there. It would allow Hamas to place all of the responsibility onto the architects of the attack and change the course of the movement's future once they are both out of the picture. In such a case, Sinwar and Deif would take with them to the grave the responsibility for the events of October 7th, for better or worse, from Hamas's perspective. There is a poetic justice in this.\n\nThis dramatic change is a result of the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran, which that could not have occurred in Qatar due to the American protection that Qatar enjoys. The cards have been reshuffled, and now there is an opportunity to break the deadlock.", "location": "or punctuation marks\nGaza Strip", "classification": "antisemitism", "score": 0.7960263775888472, "event_breakdown": "Yahya Sinwar appointed as head of Hamas's Political Bureau."}]
