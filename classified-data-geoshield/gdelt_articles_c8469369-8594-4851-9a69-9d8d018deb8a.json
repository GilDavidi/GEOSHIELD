On Friday, around five hundred students assembled in the UCLA Court of Sciences to demand that the administration condemn Israel\u2019s violence and take measures to support Palestinian students. Some activists had chained themselves to the doors of the court, while hundreds of others protested outside. Shortly before six in the evening, the so-called Marshals of UCLA arrived and began yelling to the crowd that if they didn\u2019t leave, they would be arrested. The protesters wouldn\u2019t obey demands to disperse, so they were arrested one by one. That these mass arrests occurred at UCLA illustrates the unique nature of American racism and the hypocrisy of those who have become cheerleaders for such police tactics, despite their constant claims to stand in support of the right to protest on college campuses"}]
