You don't have to be the head of the CIA to understand that. It is enough to see that they fail to avenge the assassination of a senior member of Hamas and possibly even the head of the military wing of Hamas. This fact alone proves it.\n\nAt the same time, the desperate, public calls by senior Hamas officials that Hamas will not abandon the negotiations no matter what happens, also indicate the situation of Hamas on the ground. These calls slowly degrade their honor - and honor is an important thing in the Middle East. Hamas knows this and still behaves this way.\n\nBeyond that, I would like to point out that from my personal impression in the last month, the \"pride and arrogance\" that characterized senior Hamas officials and Hamas supporters on social media is gradually disappearing.\nThey have nothing to hold on to. They have nothing to be happy about. The frequency of the videos of the military wing of Hamas, in which IDF soldiers are usually seen being harmed, is decreasing.\nIsrael now holds the strip from all sides. Rafah crossing is blocked. Israel determines which goods will enter and which won't (cleaning and hygiene materials have run out. There are no cigarettes. There is not much fruit). Drinking water is not plentiful. The sewage is flowing in the streets due to the destruction of the infrastructure.\nWhen they look to the horizon, they see no significant possibility of turning the tide of battle. When they look a few months ahead and they see Trump in the Oval Office... it has an impact. Not only in the Strip but in the entire region.\n\nIsrael for the first time manages to show a little tolerance to the outside world, which makes the clock tick more strongly in the Gaza Strip. The game of time turned slightly to the detriment of the Gazans. The appearance of an initial Israeli \"firm stand\" emerges. The international pressure on Israel has decreased, thanks in part to the heating up of the US presidential race.\n\nEverything I described above is a very positive trend change from Israel's point of view when it comes to fighting in the Strip.\nDoes this mean that Sinwar is coming out soon with a white flag?\nI don't think so.\n\nIsrael should continue the pressure as if nothing had changed. The way to speed up the breakdown of Hamas is to exhaust it on the one hand and show strength, determination and patience on the other. This is a very important key in the Middle East and now you can really feel it in the Gaza context.\nDo not rely on any claims by CNN that Hamas commanders in the Gaza Strip are exerting pressure on Sinwar.\n\nHe works in a different way, not always according to Western logic or logic that Israel would want him to work with.\nRemember he has nothing to lose. He is already in almost the worst possible condition. He will try every possible move to come out victorious.\n\nThe key from Israel's point of view is a steadfastness - \u0635\u0645\u0648\u062f, increasing pressure and closing the future off for Hamas in the Gaza Strip. So that they will not feel that they have hope. It won't take a decade.\nThis is the way to victory.", "location": "Gaza", "classification": "antisemitism", "score": 0.8165985759938876, "event_breakdown": "The Hamas leadership in Gaza is not on the verge of breaking, as has been reported in the media.

The Hamas regime is alive and well, controlling the two million Palestinians who live there. The Israeli media reports are based on a source who was not present, and may not have even heard, of closed conversations. There is no need for the media to leak rumors or anonymous sources when there are public statements from Hamas leaders themselves."}]
