What are the surrender criteria? What can be done to advance the surrender?\n\nIn recent days, there have been increasing reports in the media that the IDF is about to announce the end of the current phase of the fighting in the Gaza Strip and then move to the third phase which will be based on raids on field cells in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAs the preoccupation with the end of the current phase increases, the obvious question arises: has Hamas surrendered? Is Hamas nearing surrender? Shouldn't the surrender be certain after the ground operation in Rafah? What needs to happen for Hamas to be defeated? How do you measure surrender? Does the elimination of Sinwar or his capture mean the defeat of Hamas?\n\nI will try to answer at least some of these questions.\n\nFirst we will examine the numerical data:\n\n1. Before the war, according to various estimates in Israel, the military force in the Gaza Strip was distributed as follows:\nAbout 30 thousand operatives of the military wing of Hamas.\nAbout 10,000 operatives of the military arm of the Islamic Jihad.\nAbout 5,000-7,000 operatives of the military arms of the other Palestinian factions in the Strip.\nAbout 20 thousand operatives of the security mechanisms of Hamas.\n\nTotal armed men in the Strip (including police forces) - between 60 and 70 thousand people.\n\n2. According to the data of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, about 38 thousand Gazans have been killed so far.\n\n3. Based on an analysis of Prime Minister Netanyahu's data from last March, it appears that over 42% of those killed in Gaza are terrorists (which is an excellent figure by any international military standard). If we use this ratio for the purpose of calculation, it turns out that 16,000 of the deaths declared by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza are terrorists.\n\n4. According to a publication by Channel Kaan dated July 1, there are 1300 Gazan terrorists imprisoned in Israel.\n\n5. Hamas claims that there are 10,000 missing persons and let's assume for this purpose that there is also a ratio of 42% terrorists out of the dead. That means about 4200 terrorists are buried under the ruins (including those who were killed in tunnels).\n\n6. About a thousand terrorists were killed inside Israel on October 7th.\n\nFrom the summary of the data, it can be estimated that about 22 thousand out of about 70 thousand Gazan who carry weapons have definitively left the circle of combat.\n\nWe are left with a little less than 50 thousand still alive.\nWe need to subtract from this those wounded who cannot return to combat, and others who fled abroad, but even if we are very generous regarding the number of wounded terrorists and those who fled and allow a wide margin for the margin of error in the estimates, we are still left with tens of thousands of trained terrorists carrying weapons that allow, as of this stage, The continuation of Hamas' rule and the thwarting of any other party that aspires to be a governing alternative to Hamas.\n\nSo how is it that the IDF did not kill more terrorists?\n\nIt is important to note that the terrorists embed themselves into the civilian population and dress in civilian clothes and it is difficult to fish them out one by one with airstrikes or ground raids. According to the daily rate of deaths indicated by the Ministry of Health in Gaza in the last two months, it will take a long time to exterminate all the terrorists.\n\nRafah is a good example of this. Let's dive in:\n\nRafah's Hamas brigade contains four battalions. In an average Hamas battalion in the Gaza Strip, there are about a thousand military operatives.\nIn the current maneuver in Rafah, which according to various publications is about to end soon, according to the Chief of Staff (as of July 2), about 900 terrorists were killed out of the operatives of the 4 battalions. There are still about 3000 military operatives who were not killed and most of them apparently fled north from Rafah.", "location": "The main focus of the event mentioned in the text appears to be the Gaza Strip.", "classification": "security", "score": 0.8600722950459503, "event_breakdown": "IDF raid in eastern Rafah, killing 13 Hamas operatives\nIDF raids in Rafah and Khan Younis\nHamas fires two rockets at Sderot, Eshkol Regional Council\nIslamic Jihad fires 2 rockets at Ashkelon\nIslamic Jihad fires rocket at Ashkelon, 3 injuries\nIron Dome intercepts 2 rockets fired at Ashkelon\nIDF fired warning shots toward Gaza fishermen\nIDF fires warning shots toward Palestinians trying to breach security fence"}, {"id": "9afe303d-7ce8-49b3-8dd5-7ba3b444616c", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en29880/", "date": "2024-07-03 20:20", "message": "The IDF spokesperson announced the fall of a commander in a battle in the northern Gaza Strip.\n\nMay his memory be a blessing.", "location": "Gaza Strip", "classification": "security", "score": 0.9424130939542478, "event_breakdown": "IDF commander killed in northern Gaza Strip."}, {"id": "ce9de51f-0f8f-43ea-bcc6-92dd7650ad1a", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en29856/", "date": "2024-07-03 15:00", "message": "A lunchtime trip to the \"Great Lakes of Khan Younis\" in the south of the Gaza Strip.", "location": ")\nGAZA STRIP", "classification": "security", "score": 0.7923314154591234, "event_breakdown": "1- A lunchtime trip to the \"Great Lakes of Khan Younis\" in the south of the Gaza Strip.\n2- Unrest in Cameroon's English-speaking regions.\n3- Protests in Iran against the regime."}]
