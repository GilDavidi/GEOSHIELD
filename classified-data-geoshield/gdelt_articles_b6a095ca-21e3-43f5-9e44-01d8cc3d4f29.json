The report states that a man shot by an officer after he stabbed a victim 28 times in Siloam Mission\u2019s parking lot in 2022 still has a bullet lodged in his brain, according to the province\u2019s police watchdog. The IIU released its final report on the incident Monday, after charges against the man had been dealt with in court. The police watchdog said the first officer to approach the suspect later shot him. The shooting came after the man ignored the officer\u2019s orders to drop the knife. After being shot, the man landed on his feet and swung the knife at another officer exiting from the passenger side of a vehicle who had been sent to aid the first officer, the report said. The investigation cleared the officers of any wrongdoing and it deemed the shooting justified. The officers were put into a situation by the man who had a knife in his hand, and their use of lethal force was justified under the circumstances, and therefore, they were cleared of any wrongdoing."}, {"id": "4508d1c7-a58c-452c-9013-d5579d18e73b", "title": "Five dead in blast outside cafe in Somali capital", "date": "2024-07-15 01:00", "url": "https://www.maitlandmercury.com.au/story/8695412/five-dead-in-blast-outside-cafe-in-somali-capital/?cs=7607", "domain": "maitlandmercury.com.au", "domain_classification": "Unknown", "message": "Some people were watching the European soccer final between Spain and England on a screen inside the cafe on Sunday when a car loaded with explosives blew up outside, said Maj.
