The Palestinian Authority is not relevant in either Gaza or the West Bank.\n\nSenior Hamas official Husam Badran said these words. This is the position of Hamas and it is publicly declared. Hamas is now fighting for its place in the Palestinian leadership the day after the war. This is the main part of the negotiations it is conducting with Israel, the hostage deal is only a means to get there. Hamas wants to continue the armed struggle against Israel until liberation. It wants to lead the Palestinians. This ambition only intensified with the war.\n\nIsrael has no other choice but to wage war on Hamas. Even if it takes a decade. Whoever gives up and shows weakness, will lose. History is now being written and shaped for the next decades in the region.\n\nHere is a collection of his words:\n\n1. The government of the Palestinian Authority is unable to fulfill its role in the West Bank, so it certainly will not be able to fulfill any role in Gaza. It works in coordination with the enemy to weaken the resistance in the West Bank.\n\n2. We are working to increase and develop the resistance in the West Bank and demand that every Palestinian who carries a weapon in the West Bank, whether an official weapon or not, to think about it - everyone (the weapon bearers) can make a difference and cause a significant and qualitative change. The Palestinian should initiate.\n\n3. Every issue related to the negotiations that comes to the hands of the delegation will be examined together with the leadership in Gaza and coordinated with it.\n\n4. Throughout all stages of the negotiations, we refused to discuss the issue of the day after. The resistance will not allow anyone to dictate anything to it regarding the internal order on the Palestinian front. We will discuss the arrangement of the Palestinian internal front after the war and not the \"Gaza after the war\" issue.\n\n5. It is not possible to create a new Palestinian internal order without Hamas being present and having influence. The international authorities know that Hamas cannot be eliminated and that all attempts to pressure Hamas into concessions have failed.\n\n6.
