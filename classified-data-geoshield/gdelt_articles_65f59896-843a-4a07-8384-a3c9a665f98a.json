Khiara\".The Israeli military meanwhile said in a statement that a drone had \"crossed from Lebanon and fell in the area of Beit Hillel\", adding that \"no injuries were reported\".Hezbollah later said it had struck with a \"squadron of assault drones\" the \"headquarters of the newly created 91st Division in Ayelet Hashahar\" near the northern Israeli city of Safed.Cross-border tensions have surged in recent days, with Israel's military announcing on Tuesday that a plan for an offensive in Lebanon had been \"approved and validated\".Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah responded with threats that no part of Israel would be spared in the event of an all-out war.The Lebanese armed group on Saturday evening published a video showing Israeli positions and coordinates, along with an excerpt of Nasrallah's speech in which he says \"if war is imposed on Lebanon, the resistance will fight without restrictions or rules\".Days earlier, it had circulated a nine-minute video showing aerial footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including what it said were sensitive military, defence and energy facilities and infrastructure in the city and port of Haifa.The cross-border
