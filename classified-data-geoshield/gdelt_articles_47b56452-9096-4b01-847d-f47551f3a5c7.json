A few pamphlets were left in a parking garage at a local mall, as well.\n\nThe tract reportedly referenced the holiday of Purim, which was last Sunday\n\n\"These disturbing messages of hate and intolerance have no place in our country or city,\" Beverly Hills Mayor Lili Bosse wrote in a statement. \"We stand united against all forms of hate and encourage everyone to oppose hatred and report incidents to the authorities. We are coordinating with the Beverly Hills PD to fully investigate and make sure those responsible are held accountable.\"\n\nOther fliers contained the phrase \"we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\"\n\nBosse said that the fliers appear to be linked to a group called the Goyim Defense League, a loosely organized network of individuals associated [with] known neo-Nazis such as members associated with the Rise Above Movement, a white supremacist group that advocates violent racism, promotes anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and trains for acts of violence.\n\nThe flyers and stickers disseminated by the hate group have been found across the country. According to the ADL, the GDL (Goyim Defense League) spreads \"racist, antisemitic and anti-government\" propaganda.\n\nThe Beverly Hills Police Department has asked residents to call the Beverly Hills PD at 310-550-5536 to report any information about these pamphlets or any other incidents involving the distribution of such material"}]
