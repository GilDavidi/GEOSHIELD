The Israeli military said earlier Wednesday that early in the morning, air defenses shot down an unmanned aircraft heading towards the Negev desert.  The military said sirens were triggered by a drone flying one way from the Gaza Strip towards the city of Eilat.  No missiles were fired towards Israeli targets, but a siren rang out in some parts of southern Israel.  This attack comes less than a week after the United States announced that it would end its eight-month deployment of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower to the Gulf region, following months of threats from Iran."}, {"id": "da1a93f4-7ef2-40d6-8521-e9fbef6311f2", "title": "Hays County man arrested after two - hour standoff with deputies", "date": "2024-06-26 02:15", "url": "http://www.expressnews.com/hill-country/article/dripping-springs-standoff-arrested-hays-county-19539053.php", "domain": "expressnews.com", "domain_classification": "Unknown", "message": "Liz Teitz covers the Hill Country for the San Antonio Express-News.\nShe can be reached at liz.teitz@express-news.net.\nShe previously covered education and news in Texas, Colorado and Connecticut.\nShe grew up in Rhode Island and graduated from Georgetown University.", "location": "Hill Country", "classification": "security", "score": 0.4500907593736472, "event_breakdown": "Relevant security events reported in text:\n- Liz Teitz covers the Hill Country for the San Antonio Express-News.\n -
