Storm Debby\nTropical Storm Debby was a tropical cyclone that produced heavy rainfall and flooding across portions of the Southeastern United States in August 2024. The fourth named storm of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, Debby formed from a low pressure area that persisted over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico in early August. On August 5, the system developed into Tropical Depression Four, and subsequently strengthened into Tropical Storm Debby on August 6. The storm then moved inland over southwestern Florida, and weakened to a tropical depression on August 7 before dissipating over South Carolina.\n\nDespite its relatively weak intensity, the storm caused significant rainfall and flooding along its path, particularly in portions of Florida and South Carolina. Rainfall amounts ranging from 5 to 10 inches (130 to 250 mm) were common, and some areas received more than 15 inches (380 mm) of rain. High winds and storm surge also caused damage in coastal areas. In Georgia, storm surge caused street flooding in Savannah. In South Carolina, flooding forced the evacuation of residents from their homes in Ridgeland.\n\nOverall, Tropical Storm Debby caused $7.9 billion in damage, primarily from flooding and storm surge. The storm killed 36 people, the majority of which were due to inland flooding. It was the costliest and deadliest tropical cyclone of the season."}, {"id": "08e145bd-1041-4881-b697-647c0e62f4cc", "title": "Rowan - Salisbury Schools cancel first day of class amid Debby", "date": "2024-08-07 18:15", "url": "https://www.wbtv.com/2024/08/07/rowan-salisbury-schools-cancel-first-day-class-amid-debby/", "domain": "wbtv.com", "domain_classification": "Unknown", "message": "SALISBURY, N.C.
