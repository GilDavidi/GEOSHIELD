Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi also specifically denied the assassination of Muhammad Deif.\n\nNo senior Hamas official has publicly denied the assassination of Rafa'a Salameh, Brigadier General of Khan Yunis. None of the senior Hamas officials has publicly positively confirmed that Salameh was eliminated, but the non-denial in this case, against the background of the vigorous denial regarding Muhammad Deif, stands out and has weight.\n\nMoreover, the newspaper Alsharq al-Awsat claims, although from unknown sources in Hamas, that Salameh was indeed eliminated, but Hamas, as is customary in war, almost always does not publicly admit to their losses. This is a decision made by the Hamas leadership in order to suppress the number of deaths in the ranks of Hamas, in order not to damage internal morale and so that they can claim that Israel almost always only kills women and children... a tactic that has turned out to be successful thus far, as far as Hamas is concerned.\n\nAnother point that should be taken into account: if Hamas itself publicly admits that Salameh was killed, it is an admission that its leaders are hiding among the civilian population, so it is likely that even if a Hamas senor member is killed, Hamas will not be in a hurry to admit it.\n\nThe IDF and the ISA have confirmed that Rafa'a Salameh was indeed eliminated, even if Hamas does not admit it publicly.\n\nAnd what about Muhammad Deif, eliminated or not?\n\nThere is no clarity regarding this. The public and vigorous denials of Hamas certainly have weight in my opinion, since if Deif is eliminated, senior Hamas officials will come out as liars to a global audience which could indicate that they have reliable information.\n\nOn the other hand, the speed of denying his assassination and the firmness among senior Hamas officials outside the Strip, while intelligence officials in Israel still do not know how to confirm or deny the death of Muhammad Deif, raise doubts. Is it possible that this time, in this exceptional case, and due to the high status of Muhammad Deif and the symbol he represents, senior Hamas officials are betting on the results without certain information?\nThis is certainly a reasonable possibility.\nI estimate that if external sources in Hamas (outside the Gaza Strip) had reliable information regarding Deif's fate, it is likely that this information would also have been found by Israeli intelligence sources.\n\nWe will have to wait to know what happened to Deif. All possibilities are currently on the table.\n\nWhat is important to do right now is to focus on the presence of senior officials in the military wing of Hamas among the civilian population, hiding beside them in the humanitarian zone.
