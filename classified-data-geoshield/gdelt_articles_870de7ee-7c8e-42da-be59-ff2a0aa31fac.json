A few days before Russia declared war on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Poprotskyi received a job offer from an Australian entrepreneur. Marqo, an artificial intelligence start-up founded by Hamer, was looking to hire Poprotskyi to work on a coding project.\n\nRussia Declares War on Ukraine\nRussia declared war on Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The invasion was a surprise to many, including Poprotskyi, who was working on the project in Australia at the time. Poprotskyi recalls the day vividly, saying he was woken up to the sound of an explosion. The 18-year-old spent the night hiding in a bomb shelter and experienced non-stop bombing.\n\nPoprotskyi realized that it was time to try to leave the country, saying that he felt the \"treachery of the situation.\" The experience was \"terrifying,\" and Poprotskyi was scared for his life.\n\nPoprotskyi has since relocated to Australia and is currently working as a software engineer for Marqo.\nRussia Declares War on Ukraine\nPoprotskyi's story highlights the uncertainty and danger that many Ukrainians face as a result of the Russian invasion."}, {"id": "0e8cc9bb-5c3f-4101-bc47-72c38a78b7f5", "title": "Hezbollah fires over 200 rockets into Israel after killing of senior commander", "date": "2024-07-04 19:45", "url": "https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/national/24431736.hezbollah-fires-200-rockets-israel-killing-senior-commander/", "domain": "theboltonnews.co.uk", "domain_classification": "Unknown", "message": "Following the attack, Israel struck various towns in southern Lebanon.\nThe Israeli military said it hit Hezbollah\u2019s \u201cmilitary structures\u201d in the southern border towns of Ramyeh and Houla.\nHours after the killing, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights.\nHezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its October 7 attack into southern Israel.\nIsrael sees Hezbollah as its most direct threat and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles.", "location": "Israel", "classification": "security", "score": 0.9847992107571666, "event_breakdown": "Israel attacking Hezbollah's \"military structures\" in the border towns of Ramyeh and Houla in response to the Hezbollah rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads that were fired into Israel."}, {"id": "089dbb76-283d-46cf-ae7e-57b5df0b3639", "title": "Life and death in Gaza  safe zone  where food is scarce and Israel strikes without warning", "date": "2024-07-04 03:00", "url": "http://lasvegassun.com/news/2024/jul/03/life-and-death-in-gazas-safe-zone-where-food-is-sc/", "domain": "lasvegassun.com", "domain_classification": "Unknown", "message": "Life and death in Gaza\u2019s \u2018safe zone\u2019 where food is scarce and Israel strikes without warningJehad Alshrafi / APKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip \u2014 An Israeli airstrike slammed into a residential building next to the main medical center in Gaza\u2019s southern city of Khan Younis, wounding at least seven people, hospital authorities and witnesses said Wednesday.\nNasser Hospital sits in the western part of the city, which is inside the Israeli-designated humanitarian \u201csafe zone\u201d where Palestinians have been told to go, according to maps provided by Israel's military.\nThe latest Israeli evacuation order affected about 250,000 people earlier this week across wide swathes of Gaza, the United Nations estimated.\nThe Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike.\nThe Israeli military said Tuesday it estimates at least 1.8 million Palestinians are now in the humanitarian zone it declared, covering a stretch of about 14 kilometers (8.6 miles) along the Mediterranean.", "location": "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip", "classification": "security", "score": 0.8175660560465854, "event_breakdown": "Israeli airstrike hits residential building next to main medical center in Khan Younis, Gaza, wounding at least seven people."}, {"id": "8e412e67-f6e4-4067-b7c9-6304bf3d16ff", "title": "Hezbollah fires over 200 rockets into Israel after killing of senior commander", "date": "2024-07-04 20:00", "url": "https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/national/24431736.hezbollah-fires-200-rockets-israel-killing-senior-commander/", "domain": "bucksfreepress.co.uk", "domain_classification": "Unknown", "message": "Following the attack, Israel struck various towns in southern Lebanon.\nThe Israeli military said it hit Hezbollah\u2019s \u201cmilitary structures\u201d in the southern border towns of Ramyeh and Houla.\nHours after the killing, Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets and Falaq rockets with heavy warheads into northern Israel and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights.\nHezbollah says it is striking Israel in solidarity with Hamas, another Iran-allied group that ignited the war in Gaza with its October 7 attack into southern Israel.\nIsrael sees Hezbollah as its most direct threat and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles.", "location": "southern Lebanon", "classification": "security", "score": 0.9847992107571666, "event_breakdown": "Israel struck Hezbollah's military structures in southern Lebanon on Monday, after the attack killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded seven.
