The goal is its survival as a ruling movement in Gaza.\n\nIsrael needs to announce to the whole world that it is ready to stop fighting today in exchange for disarming Hamas and expelling its senior officers and military operatives outside the Strip.\nThis is a reasonable condition for anyone who is not interested in Hamas as a governing body in the Gaza Strip after the war. This is a condition that the USA cannot oppose. It is a legitimate condition that can bring about the end of the war and may have broad support in the West.\n\nIt is forbidden to return to the same stage of the negotiations.
