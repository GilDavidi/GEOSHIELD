Edwin Adrian Sumantha, stated in Jakarta on Thursday.He remarked that the visit would hopefully enhance the cooperation between Indonesia and Turkey in the defense industry, adding that Prabowo's transit at Istambul Airport was made during his flight back from Moscow, Russia, to Jakarta.Sumantha said that Prabowo, accompanied by Indonesian Ambassador to Turkey Achmad Rizal Purnama, also met with Baykar Technology CEO Baykar Hayluk Bayraktar, during which they engaged in a brief conversation.Ambassador Purnama was quoted as expressing belief in further collaboration between Jakarta and Baykar Technology to drive the modernization of Indonesia's defense system that would positively contribute to regional security.He noted that Prabowo was given a Bayraktar Kzlelma fighter UAV miniature before leaving the company.Sumantha also said that the Indonesian Navy and Air Force chiefs of staff had hinted at the possibility of the Indonesian Government procuring Anka and Bayraktar combat drones.He stated that the Indonesian Defense Ministry had recently signed a procurement contract for 12 Anka combat drones with Turkish Aerospace Industries on February 3, 2023.The procurement contract also covered a training program, transfer of technology, and support for integrated logistic support (ILS), ground support & test equipment (GS&TE), a flight simulator, hangar infrastructure, and a 24-month or 600-flight-hour warranty period.The procurement contract, however, still awaits the Indonesian Finance Ministry's activation.According to its official website, Baykar Technology has been recorded as the first producer of Turkey's first indigenous UAVs.Due to its self-financed R&D activities and 93 percent localization rate, Baykar, which currently employs more than 4,500 workers, has delivered more than 500 UAVs since 1986.The company claims that its research and development (R&D) capabilities include the completecomplete design and development of UAV systems, aerial platforms, and ground components with their subsystems.\nTranslator: Genta TM, Rahmad NasutionEditor: Tia MutiasariCopyright \u00a9 ANTARA 2024"}, {"id": "00fc336c-075f-4496-8080-bf1ef2d79e14", "title": " ( AI ) mageddon : Who is Liable When Autonomous Weapons Attack ?
