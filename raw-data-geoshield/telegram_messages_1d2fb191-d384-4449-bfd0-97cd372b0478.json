It shows shooting at the settlement of Bat Hefer.\n\nThe main and official channel of the military arm of Hamas did not publish the video and the attempt to imitate the Gaza Hamas videos seems relatively amateur (I will share an official Hamas video for comparison).\n\nThis indicates, at the very least, that the relationship between Hamas in Gaza, which produces professional videos, and the same organization in Tulkarm is not strong at this time (it can be estimated that elimination of Hamas officials of the West Bank HQ in Gaza is doing its part). The organization in Tulkarm could have used professionals to get a better product but chose to continue independently...\nThe main shortcomings in the Tulkarm video that I noticed:\n1. General quality - shooting and editing at a low level\n2. Black border too wide\n3. The red triangle is not the same one of the Hamas videos\n4. The date is displayed different by Hamas in Gaza"}, {"id": "d598ca0f-871f-4cb5-9f9d-35b29fd7fa65", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en28049/", "date": "2024-05-29 11:44", "message": "Sources associated with the Shiite axis claim that the Houthis in Yemen managed to shoot down an advanced American MQ9 UAV in the Marib area.\n\nAccording to its body, which is relatively complete, it can be estimated that it made an emergency landing.\nThe Houthis will soon provide an \"official announcement\".\n\nThis is the third MQ9 type UAV that the US has been lost in recent weeks in Yemen.\nThe cost of each unit is about 30 million dollars."}, {"id": "9a542e2d-2907-4abd-a28f-c33035443c35", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en28048/", "date": "2024-05-29 11:37", "message": "The Spanish Foreign Minister: What the Palestinian prisoners are going through in Israeli prisons is unacceptable!\n\n##\nAnd what do you say about what the abductees are going through in Gaza, Mr. Minister?
