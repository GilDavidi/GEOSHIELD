that move inland from the shoreline.\nStorm Surge WarningA warning indicated that there is dangerous, life-threatening inundation from rising waters, usually within 36 hours.\nTIMELINE: When Tropical Storm Debby will impact the Tampa Bay areaFactors impacting storm surgeThe NHC said storm surge is sensitive to the slightest changes and can be impacted by several factors.\nStorm intensity- Higher wind speeds = Higher storm surgeForward speed- Faster storm = Higher surge at coastline, Slower storm = Surge goes further inlandSize- Larger storm = Higher surgeAngle of Approach- Perpendicular to coast = Higher storm surge, Parallel or oblique = lower storm surgeWidth and Slope of Ocean Bottom- Wide, gentle slope = Higher storm surge, Narrow, steep slope = Lower storm surgeShape of Coastline-
