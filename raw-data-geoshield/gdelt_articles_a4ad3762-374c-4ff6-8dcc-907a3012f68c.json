2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs that he feared could be dropped on Rafah, where more than 1 million residents in the Gaza Strip have taken refuge, the officials said.\nThe administration is reviewing whether to hold back future transfers, including guidance kits that convert so-called dumb bombs into precision-guided munitions.The decision to delay the delivery of the 3,500 bombs was the first time since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack that Biden has used his power to curtail arms as an instrument to influence Israel's approach to the war that followed.\nA number of Biden's Democratic allies in Congress have for weeks urged him to limit or halt arms shipments to Israel, something he had refused to do until now because of his strong support for the effort to destroy Hamas Israeli officials disclosed the weapons pause to Axios earlier this week, but U.S. officials refused to confirm it either at briefings or privately until Tuesday night.\nIn fact, officials said the administration had just approved the latest tranche of aid amounting to $827 million worth of weapons and equipment.\nThe administration intends to send \"every dollar\" of the money just appropriated by Congress, the officials said.But they said they were especially worried about the damage that could be done by the 2,000-pound bombs in a dense urban area like Rafah with so many displaced
