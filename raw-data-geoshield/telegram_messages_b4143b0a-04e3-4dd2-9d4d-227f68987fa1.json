This year, the Iranians always took revenge by the 12th day after hoisting the revenge flags...\n\nThe Americans are throwing all their weight behind preventing regional escalation and are deploying military forces on an unprecedented scale: aircraft carriers, submarines, tens of thousands of soldiers and much more. At the same time, last night's report on the approval of a large arms deal in the amount of 20 billion dollars and the announcement by the Western countries of their commitment to the defense of Israel - are doing their part. It certainly deters Iran and Hezbollah.\n\nIn addition, today the US is sending special envoy Amos Hochstein to Beirut, at the same time as a broad diplomatic effort aimed at Thursday - negotiations on a ceasefire deal in Gaza.\nThe Iranians already sound less determined than before regarding revenge. The public announcements are more hesitant.\n\nIt is evident that everyone is waiting with eager anticipation for the results of the round of negotiations on Thursday and the Biden administration really wants it to succeed this time - this will surely also bring unprecedented pressure on Israel behind the scenes.\n\nThe big danger is that the greater the expectation from the negotiations, the greater the disappointment if the round does not succeed."}, {"id": "318ee9fd-95c8-48bb-bbd4-0f1cc79d4ae0", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/heb73225/", "date": "2024-08-14 06:58", "message": "The operation in Tubas and Tamun:\nThe Palestinians report that the IDF forces are in possession of three bodies of Palestinians who were killed as a result of the (first ever) Israeli aircraft attack in Tamun."}, {"id": "bd838be3-2b44-43bb-8117-0b056c9f02ec", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32392/", "date": "2024-08-14 06:55", "message": "Lebanon: Lebanese channels claim that tonight Israeli warplanes fired shots over the airfield in Beirut and over the Dahieh area."}, {"id": "5479273e-f29d-4564-b32a-0dde4f863697", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32391/", "date": "2024-08-14 06:54", "message": "Brazil neighborhood in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip - the erasure of buildings."}, {"id": "48bf648a-d4ac-483e-8386-796c87a860ec", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32390/", "date": "2024-08-14 06:54", "message": "The IDF spokesman published an infographic of the location from which Hamas launched rockets towards Tel Aviv yesterday.\n\nThe launch was made from Khan Yunis right inside the humanitarian route through which the aid trucks pass from the south of the strip to the center and north.\n\nThe IDF spokesman reported that the IDF attacked the area from which the launches were carried out yesterday."}, {"id": "f5269473-e764-4dbb-a6af-222baf28e51b", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32389/", "date": "2024-08-14 06:51", "message": "Gaza Strip:\nThe Palestinians report 12 deaths tonight in two IDF attacks in the Maghazi refugee camp in the center of the Gaza Strip:\n8 killed in the attack on the house of the Abu Nada family.\n4 killed in the attack on the Eid family home.\n\nIt was also reported that two more were killed in the attack on the Mazin family home in Beit Lahia in the north of the Gaza Strip."}, {"id": "17d60520-08b2-42e9-a707-6bbaa06fdeb9", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32387/", "date": "2024-08-14 06:50", "message": "Palestinian channels report that in the early morning the PA's security mechanisms detonated, in a controlled manner, an explosive device that was planted to hit IDF forces in Jenin."}, {"id": "70c431be-4765-49ae-8cae-789538d994bd", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32385/", "date": "2024-08-14 06:48", "message": "The IDF announced a military operation in Tubas and Tamun in northern Samaria\n\nBefore this morning's announcement of the operation, IDF forces surrounded a building in Tubas where terrorist Faiz Dagharma - a released prisoner - was hiding.
