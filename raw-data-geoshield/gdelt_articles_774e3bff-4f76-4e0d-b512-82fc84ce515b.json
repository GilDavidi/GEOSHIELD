how the government will continue to invest in defence and security needs under the Defence White Paper (DWP) published in 2019 without any actual figure being stated is interesting, although there is acknowledgement that defence spending is long-term and lasts beyond the allocations of a five-year Malaysia Plan (MP).\nWhat the DWP really reveals is the government\u2019s commitment to trimming the national debt, which will have to be balanced with defence spending aims that are long-term and stable, as well as affordable and sustainable.\nMilitary spending under Budget 2024 is approximately 1% of GDP compared to 0.98% of GDP under Budget 2023.\nCAP-55 envisions two multirole combat aircraft squadrons and three light combat aircraft squadrons, with defence analysts estimating that a total of around 100 aircraft will comprise these squadrons.\nThis is the ideal and is unlikely given the historic military spending and the country\u2019s current economic prospects."}, {"id":
