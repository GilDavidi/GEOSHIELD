Bukele heads a party that holds 56 of the 60 seats in parliament. He dramatically lowered crime in the country by... less democratic means.\nThe results spoke for themselves- his achievements are appreciated. The judges he appointed allowed him to change the constitution and be elected for another term.\nLeft-liberal European leaders distance themselves from Bukele.
