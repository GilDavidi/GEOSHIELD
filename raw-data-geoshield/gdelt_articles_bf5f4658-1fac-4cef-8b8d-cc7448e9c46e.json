back in 100-plus-degree weather and with these extreme temperatures and drought, we want to remind you of the dangers of wildfires.\nFirefighters warn that the combination of extreme heat and dry conditions has created a perfect storm for wildfires, posing significant threats to both nature and local property.\nCloud cover brings slight cool down this weekendAccording to Wichita Falls Fire Marshall Craig Berend, higher temperatures combined with lower humidity can cause grassfires to ignite and strong winds push the fires in North Texas.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a fair amount of rain this spring and that has only increased the vegetation, which adds to the fuel.\nWith higher temperatures, firefighters get tired quicker and all of that helps deplete our resources.\u201d Berend said."},
