afternoon, according to the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC).\nThe storm brought heavy rain and strong winds forcing residents to stay indoors and keeping more than 26,000 without power, officials said.\nEarlier, the NHC warned of strong winds, a dangerous storm surge and significant coastal flooding.\nDue to the large size of the storm and its slow movement, tropical storm force winds and gusts to hurricane force are expected to continue through Saturday afternoon, with tropical storm-strength winds continuing well into Sunday, the Bermuda government said.\nThe island is a renowned offshore financial centre with sturdy construction, and given its elevation, storm surge is not as problematic as it is with low-lying islands."}, {"id": "f7bd57ca-2468-4d07-bc38-2121a2b1f9e3",
