embassy and demanded that Israel stop the genocide it is committing on Palestinian soil.Coordinator of ARI-BP, Zaitun Rasmin, called on people and the international community to push Israeli occupation authorities to release the Palestinian people they currently imprison.\n\"We also demand that the genocide in Gaza be ended and the blockade put in the region be lifted permanently,\" he emphasized.Rasmin then urged all member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to deploy military assistance to the Gaza Strip in order to save residents from Israel's atrocities.During the strike, the demonstrators also condemned the assassination of Palestinian leaders, including Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the political bureau of the resistance movement Hamas, who was killed in an Israel airstrike targeting his residence in Tehran, Iran, on July 31.To honor the deceased freedom fighter who once served as the Palestinian prime minister, the people offered an absentee funeral prayer.On the occasion, people waved giant flags of Indonesia and Palestine while displaying various attributes, such as fans and posters depicting the Palestinian flag and Haniyeh's images.\nMost of the demonstrators were seen wearing white and black clothes.Earlier, Central Jakarta Police Chief Grand Commissioner Susatyo Purnomo informed that a total of 1,309 joint personnel had been readied to maintain security and conduciveness at several points around the embassy during the mass demonstration.The joint personnel comprise police and military officers and officials from the
