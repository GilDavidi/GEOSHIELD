Portugal.\nThe course consisted of extensive lectures and practical fieldwork, visiting sites in both countries that were relevant not only to Jewish history but also to the current Jewish community.\nSignificant progress has been made there, and a modern Spanish Jewish community exists, but any attempt at memorializing their notorious Inquisition seems performative, at best.\nTo wit: In Spain, the Spanish Inquisition and its accompanying expulsion are memorialized by small, embedded wall plaques at several key locations.\nIndeed, anti-Zionism isn\u2019t antisemitism, until it is \u2013 and this includes the searing contempt with which Israel is treated because it is a Jewish state."}, {"id": "68b9b36c-0f3b-486b-a7c5-b59f105808a8", "title": "Jewish Culture Fest held Sunday in
