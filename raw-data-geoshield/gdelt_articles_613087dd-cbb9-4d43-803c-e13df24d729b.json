opportunity and action at a time when nearly one-fifth of earth\u2019s land is damaged, forests are disappearing, water bodies are shrinking, and farms are turning into dust bowls.\nEmbracing sustainable developmentIndeed, GCC states have emerged as true global leaders in the fight against climate change and embracing sustainable development.\nThe World Environment Day hosted by the region is the perfect occasion to reflect why the cities of the future must be sustainable and smart, and help preserve our precious natural resources for future generations, through collaborative work between the private and public sectors.\nAs demonstrated by pioneering sustainable projects in the UAE, such as Sharjah Sustainable City, cities that offer an eco-friendly lifestyle and pave the way for a net-zero future are already here.\nThat\u2019s why there\u2019s no better time than this World Environment Day to turn those ambitions and commitments into a turning point for environmental action for a transformative future."}]
