US petrol futures and options since before the pandemic, anticipating that prices would continue climbing.\nSecond-month US petrol futures prices have recently traded US$21 per barrel above front-month Brent, with the premium down from more than US$28 in the middle of March.\nInvestors have noticed and liquidated many of the bullish long positions in petrol futures and options they had amassed by early April.\nAs a result, fund managers\u2019 net position was cut to 49 million barrels (41st percentile for all weeks since 2013) on May 7 from 85 million barrels (88th percentile) four weeks earlier.\nThe hedge fund community had a neutral or even slightly bearish outlook on petrol prices having been strongly bullish just a month before."}, {"id":
