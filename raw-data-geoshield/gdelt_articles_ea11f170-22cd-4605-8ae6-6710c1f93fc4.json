Grimm galleryIn 2022, while doing research in a Latin American archive in Texas, the Peruvian artist Claudia Mart\u00ednez Garay came across a curious musical score.\nMart\u00ednez Garay set about learning to play it on the synthesiser.\nThe anonymous priests who wrote it had opted for Quechua so, as Mart\u00ednez Garay puts it, \u201cthey could speak to the people\u201d.\nMart\u00ednez Garay makes the kind of variegated, detailed art you want to explore like you would a map.\nMart\u00ednez Garay often opts for rhizomes or mind maps as compositional tools."}, {"id":

and overcome what the corporate media has described as a disturbing legislative \u201clogjam\u201d of stalled bills, Labor teamed up with the right-wing Liberal-National Coalition to push through key anti-working class legislation.\nWhile Labor holds a slender majority in the lower house, neither party has a majority in the upper house or Senate.\nIf repeated at the next election, the newspaper concluded, the likely result would be a minority Labor government, dependent on the Greens and independents for survival.\nThe Coalition is in no better position than Labor, and both are wracked by factional infighting.\nThe Greens are generally posturing, for electoral advantage, as more progressive, while still hoping to join or support a minority Labor government after the impending election."}, {"id": "f182ee46-5798-4a6c-a66e-9bc21587ebcc", "title": "By Ignoring the Bidenite Advice , Israel Managed to Eliminate Many Hamas Jihadis", "date": "2024-08-22 02:30", "url":

of the messages the officials are expected to deliver is that there is little more Israel can accomplish against Hamas.\nIn its latest statement on the airstrike, the IDF has now identified by name 38 Hamas terrorists killed at the command-and-control center functioning inside the Al Tabin school.\nAnd dozens of other high-ranking Hamas combatants have also been killed, as the IDF continues its relentless campaign of targeted assassinations.\nNow the Bidenites are urging Israel to end its war in Gaza because, they claim, there is not much more of Hamas to destroy, and the IDF needs to avoid further civilian casualties.\nAs for civilian casualties, in the last three months Hamas has continued to claim roughly 38,000-39,000 casualties, as usual without distinguishing between civilians and Hamas operatives."}, {"id": "14788835-c978-46a9-a158-91ac826650d1", "title": "Happy Birthday Joe Strummer ! | 101 . 5 KGB", "date": "2024-08-22 02:45", "url":
