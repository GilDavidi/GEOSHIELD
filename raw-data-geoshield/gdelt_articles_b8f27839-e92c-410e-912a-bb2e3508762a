obvious that the Transnistrian domino didn\u2019t fall on this occasion.\nTherefore, it is worth pausing to consider the limits of this metaphor and observable developments in the Transnistrian conflict.\nIndeed, since the early 1960s, domino theory has faced criticism for overlooking various parameters; metaphors shape our perceptions, reinforce biases, and sometimes mask complexity, thereby exposing their limitations.\nFinally, cultural and historical differences between countries can influence how ideas and events are perceived and interpreted.\nIn short, while Moldova might need European assistance more than ever to face up to threats of Russian destabilisation, we can\u2019t be sure the resumption of the Transnistrian conflict is the most imminent risk."}, {"id": "",

response to an attack on Sunday that killed at least 45 people in a designated humanitarian zone in Rafah, southern Gaza.\nIsrael claimed it had targeted Hamas militants and had not intended to harm civilians.The security council could vote on the resolution within days, but its passage requires at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the US, Britain, France, Russia, or China.The US has previously shielded Israel by vetoing three draft council resolutions on the war in Gaza, but it has also abstained on three votes, most recently allowing the council in March to demand an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.Israel's ongoing military operation in Gaza is a response to an attack by Hamas militants on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,200 people and the capture of over 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Nearly 130 hostages are believed to still be held captive in Gaza.\nIsrael's assault on the blockaded Palestinian territory has killed
