has vowed to send \" assassination squads \" to wipe out drug cartel leaders from Mexico if re-elected in the upcoming Presidential elections, according to a Rolling Stone report .According to report, the Republican presidential nominee told three of his associates that the US military has \"tougher killers\" that can be used to \"wage war\" on Mexico's drug cartels in the midst of the country's rising fentanyl problem .Calling out for a strike similar to the execution of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi by the US military in 2019, Trump broached the notion of deploying special operations troops to carry out assassinations in Mexico's most notorious drug gangs, with or without the government's permission.Trump, according to the report, advised an ally that the US government should develop a \"kill list of drug lords\" that special forces might use to target or seize.Questioning the US government for not carrying out such strikes before, Trump said that removing cartel heads would strike fear in the hearts of \"the kingpins\" and cripple their drug operations.Trump has publicly promised to \"make appropriate use of Special Forces, cyber warfare, and other overt and covert actions to inflict maximum damage on cartel leadership, infrastructure, and operations\" if he returns to the White House.No specifics has been disclosed so far about the plans, such as how many such squads or troops would be sent to Mexico or level of cooperation with the Mexican government."}, {"id": "35ff9767-0d06-4eef-983b-6a1347a1abb1", "title": "China & Serbia Form Partnership After Depraved
