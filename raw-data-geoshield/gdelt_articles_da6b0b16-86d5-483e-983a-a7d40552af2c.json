"German utility Uniper has won a multi-billion euro arbitration against former long-time supplier Gazprom, it said on Wednesday (12 June), allowing it to tear up dormant gas supply contracts and potentially setting a precedent for similar cases.\nSources told Reuters last month that the arbitration tribunal could allow Uniper to terminate the 250 terawatt hours in dormant Russian gas contracts, some of which run until the middle of the next decade.\nWith the right of termination that we received in the arbitration ruling, we are ending the contracts with Gazprom Export,\u201d Uniper CEO Michael Lewis said in a statement.\nThe German government is also taking part in the discussions between the European Commission and those countries that are still dependent on Russian gas, Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Tuesday.\n\u201cI am personally very involved in it,\u201d Habeck said, adding that the talks aim to ensure secure gas supply for southeastern Europe without filling Russia\u2019s coffers."}, {"id": "e0ea4442-e10b-414f-91ce-5325f0b83650", "title": "Mark Alexander : Profile of Valor : Forgotten Hero ?
