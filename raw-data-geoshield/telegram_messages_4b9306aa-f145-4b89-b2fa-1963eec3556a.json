The IDF spokesman published the names of 19 terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad who were killed on the spot. There are 5 more, including a Brigadier General from the Islamic Jihad's central camp - whose elimination has not yet been verified.\n\n2. Most of the names of the terrorists published by the IDF spokesperson appear in the list of names of the 33 dead published by unofficial Palestinian channels.\n\n3. The Hamas information office claimed that about 100 people were killed in the early morning attack, but until this time, and unusually, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has not published the number of dead - I do not know of similar incidents where the Gaza ministry waited so long with the number of dead.\n\n4. Even after the names of the terrorists were published by the IDF spokesman, Hamas continues to lie and claim that there were no armed men in the compound and that 100 people were killed.\n\n5. The Palestinian claims that one-ton bombs were used are false - it can be seen in the photo of the IDF spokesman and in Palestinian documents that there are no craters in the school - unlike on the sites where such bombs fell in the past.\n\n6.
