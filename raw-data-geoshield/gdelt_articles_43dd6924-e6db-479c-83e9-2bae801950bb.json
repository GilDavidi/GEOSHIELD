Kyiv\u2019s surprise offensive into the western Kursk region.\nMoscow\u2019s forces on Sunday were in their sixth day of intense battle against Kyiv\u2019s largest incursion into Russian territory since the start of the war, which left southwestern parts of Russia vulnerable before reinforcement started arriving.\nBelarus, a staunch ally of Moscow, also sent more troops to its border with Ukraine, accusing Kyiv of violating its air space.\nUkraine has at most occupied several tens of square kilometres of Russian territory without laying claim to it, while Russia controls more than 100,000 sq km of Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognised territory.\nInjuries and EvacuationsZelenskyy said on Sunday Russia had launched nearly 2,000 cross-border strikes on Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region from the region of Kursk this summer and that such strikes deserved a Ukrainian response."}, {"id": "27c6f594-441a-4c1f-8575-42ca6b82e878", "title": "Vance supports Trump Fed idea , defends
