concerns with new report on this year's devastating wildfire season in Oregon: 'It's really important'The 2024 wildfire season has already been the most destructive one on record for the state of Oregon, OregonLive reported.\nSeventy-one large fires have burned more than 1.4 million acres since the 2024 wildfire season began (which, according to the Western Fire Chiefs Association, happens in mid-May).\nHistorically, the state has seen the most wildfires in September, which means that the final numbers could eclipse previous state records.\nOregon state officials stressed that people should be extra careful about fire safety this time of year and avoid accidentally starting fires.\nAlthough the conditions that have led the fires to spread are due to climate change, more than 70% of fires are started by people, according to the Oregon Wildfire Response & Recovery website."}, {"id": "cd607fb6-1581-4ae5-a18f-891021f04d08", "title": "Light earthquake : M4 . 4 quake has struck
