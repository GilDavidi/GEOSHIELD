nuclear weapons to secure victory in Ukraine, the Kremlin\u2019s strongest signal to date that Europe\u2019s deadliest conflict since World War II will not escalate into a nuclear war.Since Putin ordered troops into Ukraine in February 2022, he has said on several occasions that Russia would use such weapons if necessary to defend itself \u2013 comments the West says are sabre-rattling.Asked at the plenary session of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum by moderator Sergei Karaganov, an influential Russian analyst, if Russia should hold a \u201cnuclear pistol to the temple\u201d of the West over Ukraine, Putin said he did not see the conditions for using such weapons.\u201cThe use is possible in an exceptional case - in the event of a threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.\nI don\u2019t think that such a case has come.\nBecause our armed forces are not just gaining experience, they are increasing their effectiveness.\u201dRussian troops are advancing along the front line in Ukraine, Putin said, adding they had taken 880 square km of territory since the start of the year, including 47 villages and towns.Putin said Russia had increased ammunition production by more than 20 times and was outproducing Ukraine and the West on a whole series of measures.Russia\u2019s published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia \u201cwhen the very existence of the state is put under threat\u201d.\u201cBut this doctrine is a living tool and we are carefully watching what is happening in the world around us and do not exclude making some changes to this doctrine,\u201d Putin said.\n\u201cThis is also related to the testing of nuclear weapons.\u201d\u201cIf necessary, we will conduct tests.\nSo far, there is no need for this either,\u201d he added.US President Joe Biden has relaxed some restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of US weaponry inside Russia, prompting warnings from Moscow of a potentially dangerous escalation in the conflict, now well into its third year.The Russian president said on Wednesday that he could deploy conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its European allies if they allowed Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia with long-range Western weapons.Biden, speaking in France on Friday where he has been attending celebrations of the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings, reaffirmed the United States\u2019 commitment to support Ukraine and again drew a comparison between the fight against Nazi Germany and the threats posed by dictators today."}, {"id": "2b0bf98a-8ef5-43e0-80f0-dfbae3d00308", "title": "Arlington house explosion intentionally caused with gas : police \u2013 NBC4 Washington", "date": "2024-06-07 21:30",
