The school compounds were used by Hamas terrorists and commanders as command and control centers, from which they planned and carried out attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel.\n\nPrior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, surveillance, and additional intelligence.\n\n##\nI will point out that in the recent times when the IDF attacks schools and \"sensitive sites\" in the eyes of the international community, the IDF preempts, unlike in the past, and publishes shortly after the attack the background that led to it.\n\nI think this is a welcome change - to start playing on the field of international consciousness at zero time, similar to the Palestinians.
