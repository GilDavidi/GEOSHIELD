Hamas is serious about this.\n\n##\nHaniyeh presents a militant line. He talks about the defeat of the enemy, about an imminent victory and congratulates the people of Gaza for their firm stand. This is in fact the narrative that the Palestinian media outlets are pumping from morning to evening, using quotes taken from the Israeli media.
