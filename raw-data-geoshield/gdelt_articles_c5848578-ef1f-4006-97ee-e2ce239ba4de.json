health authorities said.\nVictims of hostilities over the past 48 hours remained lying on roads where fighting continued or trapped under rubble, the authorities said.A Hamas delegation arrived Saturday to be nearer at hand to review any proposals that emerge in the main talks between Israel and the mediating countries Egypt, Qatar and the United States, two Egyptian security sources said.Qatari Prime Minister HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani was expected to attend, they said.A US official said negotiators from the United States met with Egypt then bilaterally with Egypt and Qatar, and believed that representatives from Egypt and Qatar were meeting with Hamas.The Egyptian sources said the new proposals include compromises on outstanding points such as how to secure key areas and the return of people to north Gaza.However, there was no sign of any breakthrough on key sticking points, including Israel's insistence that it must retain control of the so-called Philadelphi Corridor, on the border between Gaza and Egypt.Hamas has accused Israel of going back on things it had previously agreed to in the talks, which Israel denies.\nThe group says the United States is not mediating in good faith.In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has locked horns with Israeli ceasefire negotiators over whether Israeli troops must remain all along the border between Gaza and Egypt, a person with knowledge of the talks said.A Palestinian official familiar with mediation efforts said it was too soon to predict the outcome of talks.Continuing the war will worsen the plight of Gaza's 2.3mn people, nearly all of them homeless in tents or shelters among the ruins, with malnutrition rampant and disease spreading, and risk the lives of the remaining Israeli hostages.UN humanitarian agency OCHA said in a Friday update that the amount of food aid entering Gaza in July was one of the lowest since October, when Israel imposed a full siege.OCHA said that in July the number of children with acute malnutrition in northern Gaza was four times higher than in May, while in the more accessible south, where fighting is less severe, the number more than doubled.More warfare also risks major new escalations, with Iran still weighing retaliation for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its territory last month.Meanwhile, US Air Force General CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, began an unannounced visit to the Middle East Saturday to discuss ways to avoid any new escalation in tensions that could spiral into a broader conflict, as the region braces for a threatened Iranian attack against Israel.Fighting between Israel and Iranian-backed Hezbollah since Oct. 7 has ramped up recently, including with Israeli strikes across southern Lebanon and into the Bekaa, and with more Hezbollah rocket fire into northern Israel."}, {"id": "5db7b457-644b-4fcd-a70b-ce780ad2d848", "title": "Gaza talks resume in Cairo as

"domain": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "domain_classification": "Local - Asia", "message": "NEW DELHI: The US government has approved a proposed sale to India of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) sonobuoys and related equipment worth around $52.8 million (Rs 443 crore) for the multi-mission MH-60R Seahawk helicopters being inducted by the Indian Navy .The Biden administration\u2019s notification to the US Congress on Friday said the proposed sale will support Washington\u2019s foreign policy and national security objectives by helping to strengthen the bilateral strategic relationship and improving the security of a major defence partner, India, which \u201ccontinues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions\u201d.The proposed sale will improve India\u2019s capability \u201cto meet current and future threats\u201d by enhancing its capacity to conduct ASW operations from its MH-60R helicopters, the notification said.The Navy in March this year had commissioned its first squadron of six submarine-hunting MH-60R Seahawk helicopters, armed with Hellfire missiles, MK-54 torpedoes and precision-kill rockets, at INS Garuda in Kochi, as was then reported by TOI.By next year, India is slated to induct 24 heavy-duty Seahawks, which are also equipped with multi-mode radars and night-vision devices, under the Rs 15,157 crore ($2.13 billion) contract inked with the US in February 2020.The notification said the Indian government has requested to buy AN/SSQ-53G high-altitude ASW sonobuoys, AN/SSQ-62F HAASW sonobuoys and AN/SSQ-36 sonobuoys as well as engineering, technical and logistics support.\n\u201cThe proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region,\u201d it said.Navy officers say the induction of Seahawks, which operate from decks of aircraft carriers and other frontline warships, represents a \u201csignificant capability jump\u201d in detecting and destroying enemy submarines prowling in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).The choppers can also be used for anti-ship strikes, over the horizon network-centric operations and electronic warfare missions, search and rescue, medical evacuation and vertical replenishment.\u201cThe advanced weapons, sensors and avionics suite make the Seahawks ideal for our maritime security needs, offering enhanced capabilities for both conventional as well as asymmetric threats.\nThey will enhance India\u2019s blue-water capabilities, extend the operational reach and support sustained naval operations across spectrums,\u201d an officer said.The new helicopters are crucial because the 140-warship Navy is currently grappling with just a handful of old ASW helicopters like Kamov-28s and Sea Kings, at a time when the presence of Chinese nuclear and diesel-electric submarines is only going to further increase in the IOR in the coming years.ASW choppers typically fly ahead of warships to \u201cdunk\u201d their sonobuoys into deep waters, \u201cping\u201d for enemy submarines, and then fire missiles, torpedoes and depth charges to clear the path for the fleet during hostilities.After the first 24 MH-60Rs, the Navy has projected a long-term requirement for another 123 naval multi-role helicopters (NMRHs).\nThe MH-60Rs are a replacement for the older Sea King 42/42A helicopters that were retired in the 1990s.\nThe case for the 24 choppers, incidentally, began way back in 2005."}, {"id": "a4bd56a1-8a2e-439c-af4f-efd4bfe93a1e",
