but not depth to protect the Russian interior.\nMuch like Russia's vaunted T-14 Armata, the Su-57 has been conspicuous by its absence from the Ukraine war.\nAdvertisementEven with American-made F-16 fighters arriving soon, Ukraine's air force probably can't drive off Russian jets lobbing glide bombs from 50 miles behind Russian lines, safe behind ground-based air defenses."}, {"id":
