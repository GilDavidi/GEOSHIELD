President William Lai Ching-te on Thursday announced a proposed defense budget of $19.76 billion in U.S. dollars for the 2025 fiscal year.\nThe proposal would increase military spending by 6.7 percent over 2024, reaching the highest level ever allocated for defense by the Republic of China (ROC).\nLai\u2019s record defense budget proposal was not really a radical departure from Taipei\u2019s normal spending priorities.\nThe new military budget is still considerably less than the three percent of GDP that is generally considered reasonable by international analysts, and Taiwan still spends more on social welfare, education, science, and economic development.\nTaiwan\u2019s military budget has increased every year for the past five years, after hitting a low of two percent of GDP in 2019."},
