Since the announcement of Biden's proposal, there is a feeling that this sector is heating up even more. It is possible that Hezbollah thinks that if they increase the pressure now, as an arena that Nasrallah defined as a \"supporting arena for Gaza\", then they will be able to pressure Israel to accept the terms of the ceasefire with Hamas, with the aim of quieting the north.\n\nIsrael does not have many choices.\n\nHezbollah's many weapons and ammunition have been stockpiled for one purpose. They will not disappear on their own. And if anyone has doubts about Hezbollah's intentions, Nasrallah makes sure to make them clear often: Hezbollah will never give up on a war of attrition against Israel. This is the goal in the past, this is the goal in the present, and this is the goal in the future.\n\nEven if it is not pleasant and certainly not easy, there is no one who will do the work against Hezbollah for Israel.\nEverything is at Israel's doorstep.\n\nI wrote here a few months ago in a long article that Israel is at the right time for starting a war against Hezbollah:\n\n1. The army is prepared and Hezbollah cannot at this stage surprise Israel like Hamas did on October 7.\n\n2. There is an understanding among large parts of the Israeli public that only a hard war against Hezbollah will be able to create a situation in which the residents of the north will be able to return to their homes. There is readiness and desire.\nMany understand that it is impossible to count on a political agreement with Hezbollah. So says past experience, which enabled the situation today, and the voice of reason.\n\n3. Israel managed to erode some of Hezbollah's capabilities in recent months. Not starting from scratch.\n\nIt is true that it would have been much more convenient if Trump was in the Oval Office instead of Biden, but the current reality and the recent escalation do not allow Israel to wait 7 months for the optimistic scenario from its point of view in which Trump defeats Biden in order to get more favorable terms.\n\nJust as Israel realized in retrospect (and too late) that it made a mistake by waiting for many months in vain and not entering Rafah in order to please the US and the international community, so it will realize that delaying the inevitable in the northern arena can cost it much more than it plans and wants.\n\nWhoever runs away from the fire discovers that it is chasing him.\nThere is a difficult reality in the north and it has to be faced despite the difficulties. Postponing the end will not improve the situation. Gaza is no longer the main arena that draws the bulk of the army's forces to it. The time has come to gather the courage and the strength and take care of the northern arena with all our might. Even if it takes many months or even longer.\nThere is no other choice. No one will do it for us."}, {"id": "b5108c26-210a-4291-97a5-02dc848539ce", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en28372/", "date": "2024-06-04 07:18", "message": "The Palestinians report 7 dead in a vehicle attack this morning near the technical college in the north of Deir al-Balah (central Gaza)."}, {"id": "27e9d91f-b1ce-485b-8ad2-1c5c581a227f", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en28371/", "date": "2024-06-04 07:10", "message": "The documentation of the fires in the north of Israel have been filling the Arab channels across the board since yesterday.\nThe fire \"photographs well\" and creates a lot of interest - the Arabs in the Middle East are waiting to see how Israel will react."}, {"id": "bfa1950d-5368-4ada-8220-7f63d13451e3", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en28370/", "date": "2024-06-04 07:08", "message": "A bank robbery that included shooting, this morning, in the village of Dar Salah in the eastern part of Bethlehem."}, {"id": "1ca579af-8f57-495e-baf3-a15e3b4f18d8", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en28369/", "date": "2024-06-04 07:08", "message": "Lebanon: The new Iranian foreign minister (replacing the minister who was killed in the crash) in a meeting with Nasrallah in Beirut.\n\nThe Iranian minister landed yesterday in Beirut for his first official visit since his appointment.\n\nEveryone kept their shoes on (:"}, {"id": "fec7620c-a2a1-4a38-9dbf-4f5902d4bb01", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "", "date": "2024-06-04 07:06", "message": "The elimination of the Iranian adviser in Syria \n\nYesterday \ud83d\udc46 Saeed Aviar, member of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, was killed in an attack attributed to Israel in Aleppo, Syria.\n\nFrom photos on social networks, it appears that along with the \"advisor's\" coffin, a coffin of an operative of the Fatemiyoun militia (circled in red) who was apparently also killed in the attack was sent.\nFatemiyoun is a Shiite mercenary militia that Iran operates for its needs mainly in Syria, consisting mostly of Afghans.
