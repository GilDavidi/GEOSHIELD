threats to his life while walking through Tehran.\n\u201cResistance means we are proud to walk the streets of civilised countries and travel from one nation to another,\u201d Haniyeh declared in the footage.Tragically, Haniyeh was killed at 2 am Wednesday in an attack at his Tehran residence, which also claimed the life of one of his bodyguards.\nInitial claims from Hamas pointed to an Israeli airstrike as the perpetrator, but later reports suggested that a bomb, smuggled into the guesthouse months prior, was used in the attack.Haniyeh's rise from a childhood in a refugee camp and imprisonment in Israel during the 1980s to a life of opulence in Qatar highlighted his significant role in the extremist Muslim world.\nHis assassination occurred just after he had been seen cheering the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel from his luxury office in Qatar.While Israel has yet to comment on the incident, both Hamas and Iran have accused the Jewish state of orchestrating the assassination."}, {"id": "cbd0c7af-3ad1-4b66-abef-0aecaed4e30f", "title": "Iran holds funeral for Hamas chief Haniyeh", "date": "2024-08-02 04:15", "url":

Indonesia's Defense Minister and President-elect Prabowo Subianto observed Baykar Technology's combat drones during his brief visit to \u00d6zdemir Bayraktar National Technology Center on the sidelines of his several-hour layover at Istambul Airport on July 31.Prabowo's visit to the center has demonstrated Indonesia's strong commitment to empowering its defense industry, Head of the Public Relations Bureau at Indonesia's Defense Ministry, Brig.\nGen. Edwin Adrian Sumantha, stated in Jakarta on Thursday.He remarked that the visit would hopefully enhance the cooperation between Indonesia and Turkey in the defense industry, adding that Prabowo's transit at Istambul Airport was made during his flight back from Moscow, Russia, to Jakarta.Sumantha said that Prabowo, accompanied by Indonesian Ambassador to Turkey Achmad Rizal Purnama, also met with Baykar Technology CEO Baykar Hayluk Bayraktar, during which they engaged in a brief conversation.Ambassador Purnama was quoted as expressing belief in further collaboration between Jakarta and Baykar Technology to drive the modernization of Indonesia's defense system that would positively contribute to regional security.He noted that Prabowo was given a Bayraktar Kzlelma fighter UAV miniature before leaving the company.Sumantha also said that the Indonesian Navy and Air Force chiefs of staff had hinted at the possibility of the Indonesian Government procuring Anka and Bayraktar combat drones.He stated that the Indonesian Defense Ministry had recently signed a procurement contract for 12 Anka combat drones with Turkish Aerospace Industries on February 3, 2023.The procurement contract also covered a training program, transfer of technology, and support for integrated logistic support (ILS), ground support & test equipment (GS&TE), a flight simulator, hangar infrastructure, and a 24-month or 600-flight-hour warranty period.The procurement contract, however, still awaits the Indonesian Finance Ministry's activation.According to its official website, Baykar Technology has been recorded as the first producer of Turkey's first indigenous UAVs.Due to its self-financed R&D activities and 93 percent localization rate, Baykar, which currently employs more than 4,500 workers, has delivered more than 500 UAVs since 1986.The company claims that its research and development (R&D) capabilities include the completecomplete design and development of UAV systems, aerial platforms, and ground components with their subsystems.\nTranslator: Genta TM, Rahmad NasutionEditor: Tia MutiasariCopyright \u00a9 ANTARA 2024"}, {"id": "0ff8c0e7-d059-469a-b30c-f35894510576",
