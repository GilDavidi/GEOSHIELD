Federation CEO Jeff Lieberman said in Monday's new release Holocaust education in Manitoba will empower young people in the province to \"stand up against antisemitism and hatred in all its forms.\"\nHuman Rights education bus begins tour in WinnipegA human rights education bus is also touring through Winnipeg this week and made a stop at Shaftesbury High School Monday."}, {"id":
