History is being written now. You need patience and time.\n\nThis evening, Nasrallah delivered a 63-minute long speech at an event in honor of the Lebanese Shiite cleric Ali Kourani, who died of a heart attack on May 19.\n\nNasrallah devoted the first half of the speech to words of praise for the Shiite elder. A part of about ten minutes was dedicated to the internal arena in Lebanon and the issue of not appointing a Lebanese president, and the rest was dedicated to the war against Israel.\n\nIn this part, Nasrallah enjoyed quoting senior Israeli officials as proof that the situation in Israel is the most difficult it has known since its establishment. In this context, he points out that Netanyahu, in his insistence on continuing to fight, is taking Israel to the abyss. Nasrallah devoted more than six minutes to delighting in a quote he attributes to cabinet member Gadi Eisenkot, whom he defines as the inventor of the \"Dahiya doctrine\". According to Nasrallah, Eisenkot said that an entire Israeli division is required to fight for weeks against the Jabaliya battalion, which Israel announced it had already disbanded in the past.\nNasrallah quotes the governor of the Bank of Israel who said according to Nasrallah that Israel is in an economic catastrophe.\n\nNasrallah quotes the Israelis to sow confidence, patience and hope among his listeners from the axis of resistance.\nHe emphasizes that it will be very dangerous for the peoples of the region and the countries of the region from a security, economic and political point of view if Israel wins and therefore everyone must continue their firm stand.\nHe points out on the other hand that if Israel is defeated there will be a very big and very positive change in terms of the axis of resistance and the peoples of the region, therefore he states that we must act like Netanyahu who declared that this is a war of existence for Israel.\nNasrallah claims that the axis of resistance should act according to the premise that this is a war of existence for the axis members as well.\nAccording to him, history is being written now and the future is clear: it is only a question of time, patience, long-suffering, exhaustion and standing firm. According to Nasrallah, this is how the resistance axis will succeed in defeating Israel.\nHe further adds that thanks to the students in the USA and thanks to the awakening of the peoples of the world, they are all now part of the resistance axis, as the supreme leader of Iran said, and the resistance is in its best condition yet. Unlike Israel.\nNasrallah instills hope among the members of the resistance axis: we will pray in Al-Aqsa and Palestine will be liberated from the river to the sea.\n\n##\nThe main message from Nasrallah's words that should penetrate to each and every citizen of Israel is that this is an existential war whose results will affect the entire region and reshape it. Whoever is tolerant and shows patience is the one who will win. Those who look for shortcuts will find that the Middle East is not forgiving.\nIsrael must not lose the campaign even if it takes a decade. The pressure to reach a quick end as soon as possible is a disastrous concept from Israel's point of view, when in front of it stands the concept of the Shiite axis that sees the campaign decades ahead.\nIsrael wants to win the 100 meter run, but it will find out that it is a tiring but necessary marathon run. There is no other solution. There are no magic solutions."}, {"id": "c95d2483-5999-472e-af5a-50fb08343caa", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en28178/", "date": "2024-05-31 21:32", "message": "Biden in a \"special speech\": there is a new Israeli proposal for a deal with Hamas\n\nAfter a lot of promos, the American president gave a short speech in which he revealed that Israel submitted a new proposal for a deal with Hamas that would include the release of the hostages.\nAccording to Biden, the deal consists of three phases where the first phase, which will last 6 weeks, will include the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Strip and the exchange of prisoners for hostages. According to him, the second phase could be an exchange deal that would include the Israeli soldiers who were captured, and in the third phase, an intensive rehabilitation of the Strip would begin.\nBiden urges Israel to accept the offer, which he says she herself offered...\nBiden urges Hamas to prove that it is indeed interested in a ceasefire and accept the deal.\nBiden points out that if Hamas does not accept the Israeli offer, the fighting will continue.\nAccording to him, the deal will lead to the end of the fighting and the \"acceptance of Israel in the region\" (Normalization Agreement - AA).\n\n##\nAt face value, I don't see any dramatic innovation here.
