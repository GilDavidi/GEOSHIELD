What will happen to Hamas's weapons?\n\nJust as Hamas announces several times a day in every possible media outlet that its threshold condition for a deal is a permanent ceasefire, Israel should now demand as a threshold condition for any future agreement the removal of senior Hamas officials from the Strip and the disarmament of Hamas.\n\nThis is a logical, basic, important condition, one that the US will have a hard time saying no to, which can lead to the full and real end of the war, even if the IDF does not eliminate all of Hamas's militants in the Strip (complete elimination is probably an unrealistic goal).\n\nSuch a condition would prevent Hamas from claiming victory. The winners are never exiled.\n\nThe US can and should agree to such a condition - it will allow it to create new leadership in Gaza for the day after the war. As long as senior Hamas officials are not expelled from the Strip and as long as Hamas is not disarmed, it is irrelevant to talk about \"the day after\" in the Strip.\n\nHamas will not just peacefully allow a foreign power (Israel, the US, Saudi Arabia, or anyone else...) to replace them as the ruling force in the Gaza Strip with someone else. The exile of Hamas's leaders is a necessary step, as mentioned, towards ending the war.\n\nIsrael should start demanding that the exile of Hamas and its disarmament are threshold conditions for any future ceasefire deal!
