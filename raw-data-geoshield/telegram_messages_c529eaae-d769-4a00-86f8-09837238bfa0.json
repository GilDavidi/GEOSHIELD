Later, this mechanism became the military arm of Hamas Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades.\nIn 1993, after the assassination of the commander of the military wing of Hamas at the time, Imad Akel, Mohammed Deif began to establish his status as a \"super terrorist\". Alongside the engineer Yahya Ayyash, who was in charge of Hamas' terrorist activities in the West Bank, Deif became the head of Hamas's military arm in the Gaza Strip. The two cooperated and were behind prominent terrorist attacks such as the kidnapping of the soldier Nachshon Wachsman. In 1996, Yahya Ayyash was killed, and Mohammad Def made sure to carry out a series of revenge attacks for his killing, including a deadly attack on Route 18 in Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2000 he was arrested by the Palestinian Authority but managed to escape from prison during the second intifada.\n\nAfter the assassination of the terrorist chief Salah Shehade in July 2002, Deif was appointed the supreme commander of the military wing of Hamas, until his assassination on July 13, 2024.\n\nDeif was not revealed to the public and for many years they did not know in Israel what he looked like and in what state of health he was.\nOn rare occasions he used to send audio recordings to raise the morale of his operatives, he did on October 7th when the massacres broke out.\n\nThis is an important achievement of the IDF and Israel - first and foremost at the cognitive level - he has become a symbol, a myth and a legend in the eyes of the Palestinians and their supporters. He has been implicated for decades in the Israeli intelligence mechanisms time and time again. His elimination is an important closing of the circle.\n\nOn the practical level, his military influence at the current stage of the war was little, but Israel can and must leverage the awareness of his death and convince the senior Hamas officials who are still alive, that their time is drawing near... for if Israel succeeded in eliminating the cat with nine lives, then their chances of avoiding a similar fate are not high and it would be wise to surrender.\nLet them ask Haniyeh...\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1"}, {"id": "40592d50-4437-41a9-98c2-d24468b2798f", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en31572/", "date": "2024-08-01 08:58", "message": "Words I kept in the drawer for two weeks on Mohammed Deif (except for the last few which I added today): \ud83d\udc47"}, {"id": "913ae12d-b30c-4ec1-93a6-102019d94855", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en31571/", "date": "2024-08-01 08:56", "message": "Joint Statement by the IDF and ISA: Muhammad Deif, Hamas Chief of Staff - eliminated!\n\nThe IDF announces that on July 13th, 2024, IDF fighter jets struck in the area of Khan Yunis, and following an intelligence assessment, it can be confirmed that Mohammed Deif was eliminated in the strike."}, {"id": "15db2d67-9100-47e2-badb-82fd5ff6ca93", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en31570/", "date": "2024-08-01 08:00", "message": "The Palestinians report that at least 22 Gazan prisoners were released today by Israel.\n\nThey arrived at the Shuhada al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah in the center of the Gaza Strip."}, {"id": "0d612bf9-ab7f-4bc9-a849-23b035a8f673", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en31569/", "date": "2024-08-01 07:58", "message": "The head of the political bureau of Hamas was eliminated and the military arm of Hamas was not able to launch a single explosive at southern Israel.\n\nWho would have believed a year ago that such a thing could happen."}, {"id": "747a6872-d032-4822-955a-43fe209af0b5", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en31568/", "date": "2024-08-01 07:56", "message": "I wonder if Ismail Haniyeh, the Sunni, who led mass prayers in the Gaza Strip, ever imagined that the day after his death, his body would walk the streets of Iran surrounded by thousands of Shiites waving flags with symbols of the Shiite religion.\n\n#\u064a\u0627_\u0639\u0644\u064a\n#\u064a\u0627_\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646"}, {"id": "1acf7dbd-1e23-4194-a461-0ca3741d17f2", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en31567/", "date": "2024-08-01 07:22", "message": "The coffins of Haniyeh and his security guard were carefully wrapped with cling film (like a cut watermelon in the supermarket) for fear of leaking unpleasant odors..."}, {"id": "fd137973-1d10-4d3d-88ad-3dc83788e8c3", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en31566/", "date": "2024-08-01 07:21", "message": "Ismail Haniyeh and the 300th day of the war:\n\nHow it started\nHow it's going"}, {"id": "265925c7-0ced-49fa-9634-a5bb0b8415bd", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en31565/", "date": "2024-08-01 06:17", "message": "The Lebanese Al-Akhbar newspaper, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, accuses:\nThe American envoy Amos Hochstein is a full partner in the elimination of Fuad Shukr.
