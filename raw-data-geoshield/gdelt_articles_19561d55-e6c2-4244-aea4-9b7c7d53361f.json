"deccanchronicle.com", "domain_classification": "Unknown", "message": "Hamas on Sunday urged Gaza mediators to implement a truce plan presented by US President Joe Biden instead of holding more talks, as Palestinians fled a new Israeli military operation.The statement from the Palestinian group, whose October 7 attack on Israel triggered the war, came a day after one of the deadliest reported Israeli strikes on the besieged Gaza Strip in more than 10 months of war.International mediators had invited Israel and Hamas to resume talks towards a long-sought truce and hostage-release deal, after the fighting in Gaza and the killings of Iran-aligned militant leaders sparked fears of a wider conflict.Israel, whose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been accused of prolonging the war for political gain, has accepted the invitation from the United States, Qatar and Egypt for a round of talks planned for Thursday.Hamas said Sunday it wanted the implementation of a truce plan laid out by Biden on May 31 and later endorsed by the UN Security Council, \"rather than going through more negotiation rounds or new proposals\".Hamas \"demands that the mediators present a plan to implement what they proposed to the movement... based on Biden's vision and the UN Security Council resolution, and compel the (Israeli) occupation to comply\", it said.Unveiling the plan, Biden had called it a three-phase \"roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages\", and said it was an Israeli proposal.\n'Have to go somewhere'Hamas officials, some analysts and critics in Israel have said Netanyahu has sought to prolong the fighting for political gain.Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah and other regional allies have vowed retaliation for Haniyeh's killing and that of Hezbollah's military chief Fuad Shukr.Biden, asked what his message was to Iran, responded: \"Don't.\n\"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered an aircraft carrier group to hasten its arrival in the Middle East, the Pentagon said Sunday.Austin also ordered the USS Georgia guided missile submarine to the area, a Pentagon spokesman said.The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said that \"just in the past few days, more than 75,000 people have been displaced in southwest Gaza\", where Khan Yunis is located.The entire Gaza Strip has a population of about 2.4 million people.Umm Sami Shahada, a 55-year-old displaced Palestinian, said she had \"fled Gaza City at the start of the war for Khan Yunis\", hoping to find shelter.\n\"My daughter was killed in bombardment, so we went to Rafah, then we came back here, and now with this new evacuation order we don't know where to go,\" she said.Families gathered their meagre belongings as crowds of people left Al-Jalaa, some loading mattresses, clothing and cooking utensils into pick-up trucks.\nOthers took to the road on foot or left on donkey-drawn carts.Majd Ayyad, displaced from Gaza City, said: \"We have to go somewhere, and we don't know if it will be good or bad.\""}, {"id": "e514c9a0-7e76-4620-a95a-660687928524", "title": "Walz Slammed by Former Battalion Leader :  He Did Not Earn the Rank  ", "date": "2024-08-12 11:00", "url":
