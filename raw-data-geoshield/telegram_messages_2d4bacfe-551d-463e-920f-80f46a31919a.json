It gives the impression that there is a new marketing move here, but the fundamental differences that prevented reaching an agreement, earlier, remain. There is an attempt to wrap the disputes in a new vague branding in the hope that it will hold water.\nI suggest that Biden press for a new deal that talks about the day after - the elimination of Hamas and its disarmament. This would make it possible to end the war now. He should focus there. Hamas is trying to maintain its rule in the Strip. This is the heart of the matter. The kidnapping is only a means and not an end for Hamas."}]
