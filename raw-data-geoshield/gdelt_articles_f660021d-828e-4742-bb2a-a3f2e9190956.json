considered the Israeli bombing of the school as an extension of the ongoing genocide in Gaza and a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, the Geneva Conventions, relevant United Nations resolutions, and orders from the International Court of Justice.The OIC viewed the United Nations' decision to include Israel, the occupying power, on the list of violators of children's rights in armed conflicts, known as the \"list of shame,\" as an important step towards supporting the rule of international law and ending the culture of impunity concerning Israeli war crimes, thereby ensuring justice for Palestinian victims.The organization called on the international community, particularly the United Nations Security Council, to fulfill its responsibilities by working to end the
