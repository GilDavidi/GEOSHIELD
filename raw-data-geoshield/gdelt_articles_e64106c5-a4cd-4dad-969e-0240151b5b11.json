Ismail Haniyeh, there have been differing reports by Hamas and Iran regarding how he was killed, according to a Saturday report by the Arabic news outlet Al-Araby.\nKhaled Qaddoumi, Hamas's representative in Tehran, said that the assassination occurred through the targeting of Haniyeh's room with an \"aerial projectile,\" citing the explosion's impact on the room.\n\"The appearance of the place after the attack and the condition of the martyred leader Ismail Haniyeh's body clearly indicate that the targeting was by an aerial projectile, whether a missile or a shell.\"\nQaddoumi's remarks were consistent with what Khalil al-Hayya, senior head of Hamas in Gaza, stated in a press conference on Wednesday, hours after Haniyeh's assassination.\nThe Al-Araby report concluded that \"In the absence of a comprehensive official narrative, the execution of Ismail Haniyeh's assassination remains mysterious, despite the known identity of the perpetrators.\""}, {"id":

McGlinchey at Stark RealitiesSecessionist inclinations are on the rise in the United States, and are sure to intensify after Nov. 5 regardless of which party prevails.\nWhen that happens, you can expect the accompanying discourse will be peppered with assertions that states have no right to secede, with many declaring the question was \u201csettled\u201d by the Civil War.\nThough the Civil War has conditioned many Americans to associate secession with war \u2014 and to reflexively recoil from it on that basis \u2014 secession is not an inherently violent proposition.\nLooking back to the run-up to the Civil War, slavery-abolitionists themselves championed secession, pushing for northern states to abandon the union.\nOthers who attempt to deny states\u2019 right of secession point to the Constitution\u2019s lack of a provision for a parting of ways."}, {"id": "3dd070bf-d84d-40c7-9edb-d3b107d352c0", "title": "Bangladesh Students Step up Protests to Press PM Sheikh Hasina
