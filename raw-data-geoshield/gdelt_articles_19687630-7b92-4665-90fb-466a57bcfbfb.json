finally joined a growing number of its NATO allies in allowing Ukraine to use weapons donated by the West to strike military targets on Russian territory.\nKharkiv lies just 40 kilometers from the Russian border, putting it in range of missile and glide bombs launched from Russia\u2019s territory.\nCrucially, Washington\u2019s relaxed restrictions allow Ukraine to make use of advanced weaponry like the long-range ATACMS missile system.\nUkraine has used British-donated Storm Shadow and American ATACMS against targets in Crimea and other occupied regions of Ukraine that Moscow considers Russian territory.\nFrance, Germany, Finland, Canada, Poland, Sweden and the Czech Republic have all said they would allow Ukraine to strike targets on Russian soil in some circumstances."}, {"id":

to demonstrate its resolve to stage a preemptive strike against South Korea if provoked.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un supervised the \"power demonstration firing\" drill involving 600 mm multiple rocket launchers on Thursday, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\nThe South Korean military said it detected the North's launch of around ten short-range ballistic missiles toward the East Sea on Thursday.\nThe North's super-large multiple rocket launch system is classified as a short-range missile that could put the entire South Korean territory within range.\nPhotos carried by state media showed 18 artillery shots being fired from multiple rocket launchers on transporter erector launchers (TELs)."}, {"id": "01cd7beb-f36b-4d6f-a6a3-1839549390c6", "title": "Russian missiles

probing operations around the area that has become one of the main focal points of the war in Gaza, now in its eighth month.The army said it had come across longer-range rockets as well as stocks of rocket-propelled grenades, explosives and ammunition as it continued \"intelligence-based operational activities\" in Rafah, which skirts Gaza's border with Egypt.Hamas fighters demonstrated their continuing strength in Rafah last week, launching missiles at Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv for the first time in months on Sunday.Islamic Jihad, Hamas' smaller militant ally, said on Friday it fired a barrage of mortar bombs at a gathering of Israeli soldiers and vehicles penetrating the vicinity of Salah al-Din Gate on Rafah's southern fringes.\nIt gave no more details.Rafah, the only major city in Gaza yet to have been taken by Israeli forces, had been a refuge for more than one million Palestinians driven from their homes by fighting in other areas of the small coastal enclave, but most have now left after being told to evacuate ahead of the Israeli operation.Hundreds of thousands are now living in tents and other temporary shelters in a special evacuation zone in nearby Al-Mawasi, a sandy, palm tree-dotted district on the coast, as well as areas in central Gaza.Israel has signalled for weeks that it intended to mount an assault on the remaining Hamas battalions in Rafah, drawing international condemnation and warnings even from allies like the United States not to attack the city while it remained full of displaced people.The risks were underlined on Sunday when an Israeli airstrike targeting two Hamas commanders outside the city set off a blaze that killed at least 45 people sheltering in tents next to the compound hit by the jets.As the war has dragged on and Gaza's infrastructure has been widely demolished, malnutrition has spread among the 2.3 million population as aid deliveries have slowed to a trickle, and the United Nations has warned of incipient famine."}, {"id": "1f57c5aa-7b3a-4267-9a3d-6c13fbf6f323", "title": "Israeli military says combat in part of north Gaza is over", "date": "2024-05-31 15:15", "url":

Tuesday as part of a series of probing operations around the area that has become one of the main focal points of the war in Gaza.The army said it had come across longer-range rockets as well as stocks of rocket-propelled grenades, explosives, and ammunition as it continued \"intelligence-based operational activities\" in Rafah, which skirts Gaza's border with Egypt.Hamas fighters demonstrated their continuing strength in Rafah last week, launching missiles at Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv for the first time in months on Sunday.Islamic Jihad, Hamas' smaller militant ally, said on Friday it fired a barrage of mortar bombs at Israeli soldiers and vehicles penetrating the vicinity of Salah al-Din Gate on Rafah's southern fringes.\nIt gave no more details.Rafah, the only major city in Gaza yet to have been taken by Israeli forces, had been a refuge for more than one million Palestinians driven from their homes by fighting in other areas of the small coastal enclave, but most have now left after being told to evacuate ahead of the Israeli operation.Israel has signalled for weeks that it intended to mount an assault on the remaining Hamas battalions in Rafah, drawing international condemnation and warnings even from allies like the United States not to attack the city while it remained full of displaced people.The risks were underlined on Sunday when an Israeli airstrike targeting two Hamas commanders outside the city set off a blaze that killed at least 45 people sheltering in tents next to the compound hit by the jets.As the war has dragged on and Gaza's infrastructure has been widely demolished, malnutrition has spread among the 2.3 million population as aid deliveries have slowed to a trickle, and the United Nations has warned of incipient famine."}, {"id": "9a038d11-d7a2-48b8-b7dd-d023c3351421", "title": "EXCLUSIVE : Wack100 on Fighting 2 White Guys After They Called Him  N **** r  ", "date": "2024-05-31 21:45", "url":
