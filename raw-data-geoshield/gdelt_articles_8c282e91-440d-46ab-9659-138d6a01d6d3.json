June 30, 2024, some well-known antisemites from across the political and ideological spectrum gathered in Somerset, Kentucky, at the \u201cJP\u201d (or Jewish Problem) Conference.\nThe JP Conference\u2019s blatantly antisemitic focus and its range of speakers is unprecedented and highlights the dangerous rise of antisemitism in the United States.\nSignificantly, on July 7, Lucas Gage posted an excerpt of his speech on X, explicitly referring to the event as \u201cthe Jewish Problem Conference.\u201dThe concept of the \u201cJewish problem\u201d \u2014 a phrase used interchangeably with the \u201cJewish question\u201d \u2014 has long and troubling roots that include the Holocaust.\nIn its most extreme form, the \u201cJewish problem\u201d found a receptive home in the Nazi movement and its eliminationist antisemitism that led to the Holocaust.\nNaming Jews as an inherent \u201cproblem\u201d allows antisemites to dehumanize the Jewish people and to unite non-Jews to fight against an ostensible \u201ccommon enemy.\u201d"}, {"id": "56f33bfd-006a-4a74-8415-0588a33e11c8", "title": "Trump comments on Jewish Democrats , second gentleman Doug Emhoff spark criticism",
