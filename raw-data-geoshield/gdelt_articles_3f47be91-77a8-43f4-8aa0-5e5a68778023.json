Thursday the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, was \u201cmuch better\u201d than the Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest military decoration, because soldiers who receive the latter had to be severely injured or killed to receive it.\n\u201cI watched Sheldon sitting so proud in the White House when we gave Miriam the Presidential Medal of Freedom,\u201d Trump said, speaking about Sheldon Adelson.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the highest award you can get as a civilian, it\u2019s the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but civilian version.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually much better because everyone gets the congressional Medal of Honor, that\u2019s soldiers, they\u2019re either in very bad shape because they\u2019ve been hit so many times by bullets, or they\u2019re dead,\u201d he went on.\nBut she got the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\u201dTrump: When we gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom\u2026 It\u2019s the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor\u2014 it\u2019s actually much better because everyone who gets the Congressional Medal, they\u2019re soldiers.\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his remarks Thursday."}, {"id": "140181fa-0ee7-43c3-b810-973ce39794d2", "title": "Police review  hate incident  at Reginald D Hunter Edinburgh Fringe show", "date":

military honor, the Medal of Honor, because those recipients are often deceased or injured.\n\u201cI watched Sheldon sitting so proud in the White House when we gave Miriam the Presidential Medal of Freedom,\" Trump said at his New Jersey resort.\nIt\u2019s the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor,\" Trump continued, referring to the highest military honor bestowed for valor in combat.\n\"But civilian version, it\u2019s actually much better because everyone [who] gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, they're soldiers.\nThey\u2019re either in very bad shape because they\u2019ve been hit so many times by bullets or they\u2019re dead,\" Trump concluded."}, {"id": "208be7e1-c841-417a-8104-498e8145c228", "title": "Police find no crime after  hate incident  at Fringe
