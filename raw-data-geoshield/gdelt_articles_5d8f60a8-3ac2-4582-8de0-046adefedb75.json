violence emanating from university campuses and other pro-Hamas protests.\nThe path from hateful rhetoric to violence is short and well-trodden.\nPrior to Aish, he was eastern director of the Simon

Pennsylvania, supported by alumni and others, have sued the institution over accusations of anti-Semitism.\nThe Deborah Project, which is representing the plaintiffs, accused the school of \u201cmaintaining \u2014 and even supporting \u2014 a hostile environment for Jews.\u201dThe complaint, filed on May 13 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that \u201cHaverford has become an illiberal institution fixated on appeasing the demands of anti-Israel students and faculty.\u201d[RELATED: Columbia Law National Lawyers Guild says Jewish students blocking divestment are threatening \u2018everyone\u2019s safety\u2019]\u201cAs a result of Haverford\u2019s capture by a fervently antisemitic anti-Israel faction, students and even tenured faculty who engage in public expression of pro-Israel viewpoints are penalized through formal investigations and other disciplinary measures, as well as through informal but pervasive stigmatization, harassment, and bullying campaigns,\u201d the Deborah Project wrote.\nAccording to the lawsuit, the anti-Semitic atmosphere present on campus led to Jewish students being afraid to \u201cspeak Hebrew in public,\u201d and made them \u201cagonize over how to suppress identifiably Jewish proclivities, gestures, or expressions, lest they be exposed as insufficiently Israel-hating Jews.\u201d\u201cNearly all of these Jewish students engage in agitated consideration every day about whether, wherever they are going on Haverford\u2019s campus to class, to the library, to a meal or to meet a friend\u2014 they are going to be met with attacks on them and the basic tenets of their religion,\u201d the lawsuit continued.\nAnd while so many of Haverford\u2019s Jews stood up on their hind legs and repeatedly attempted to get the leadership to do the right thing and fulfill their legal obligations, all were met with deaf ears.\u201dCampus Reform has reached out to Haverford College for comment.\nThis article will be updated accordingly."}, {"id": "35aacfab-e6c5-4ec9-ac46-57f8da44a093", "title": "UPenn bans encampments following pro - Palestinian protests", "date": "2024-06-06
