In my view, even in his previous role as the leader of Hamas in Gaza, Sinwar surpassed Haniyeh in skills and ambitions. Haniyeh was more of a symbolic leader than the actual \"President of Hamas.\" Sinwar has always been more dominant, sharper, more ambitious, saw further and aimed higher... perhaps too high. Sinwar believes that he can achieve things others think are imaginary or impossible - this is largely how, in collaboration with Mohammed Deif, the ambitious plan for the October 7th massacre was conceived. To implement such a plan, to think of it in the first place, one needs to be an extraordinary person, with sophisticated and exceptional thinking, great courage, insensitivity, and a certain degree of madness - all of which Sinwar possesses. Haniyeh, less so.\n\nLast night, I wrote that I think the move to appoint Sinwar as the head of Hamas's Political Bureau brings us one step closer to ending the war. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, one of the main goals of this move, in my view, is to relieve the pressure on Qatar. The Americans exerted significant pressure on the Qataris, who host the Hamas leadership abroad, to pressure Hamas into agreeing to a hostage deal. This current move neutralizes the American pressure on Qatar - the decision-making center has now entirely shifted to the Gaza Strip. This also eliminates the need for \"back and forth\" on important decisions regarding the war between Hamas leaders abroad and those inside the Gaza Strip. \n\nThe Gaza chapter of Hamas is now making the decisions, and the \"full responsibility\" lies on its shoulders. Effectively, Yahya Sinwar is the Gaza chapter, and he is now responsible for managing the war. To a large extent, the \"keys to ending the war\" lie within a small area, easily accessible to Israel and under constant physical Israeli pressure.\n\nIn my opinion, Hamas has taken an \"all in\" approach regarding the war and what is happening in Gaza, while isolating the territory (of the Gaza Strip). Gaza's fate is now in its own hands. I am convinced that Hamas leaders considered the realistic possibility of Yahya Sinwar being eliminated in Gaza when they unanimously decided to appoint him. \n\nPerhaps, in their eyes, such an event could allow them to embark on a new path, retreating from positions Hamas is currently stuck in. Positions that do not allow for the end of the fighting.\n\nThis could close the chapter of October 7th, a product of the Gaza Strip designed by Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, and could end in Gaza when those who conceived it meet their fate there. It would allow Hamas to place all of the responsibility onto the architects of the attack and change the course of the movement's future once they are both out of the picture. In such a case, Sinwar and Deif would take with them to the grave the responsibility for the events of October 7th, for better or worse, from Hamas's perspective. There is a poetic justice in this.\n\nThis dramatic change is a result of the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran, which that could not have occurred in Qatar due to the American protection that Qatar enjoys. The cards have been reshuffled, and now there is an opportunity to break the deadlock."}, {"id": "a89e6762-7cf3-4b6e-9dd6-88e5273227f3", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32062/", "date": "2024-08-07 17:51", "message": "Jordan's Minister of Information and Communications in an interview with the New York Times:\n\n\"We have informed Tehran that we will not allow the use of our airspace for any purpose.\""}, {"id": "a5f8544f-ac6e-4862-89d1-c684d277528f", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32061/", "date": "2024-08-07 17:06", "message": "Further to the publication here\ud83d\udc46, the Lebanese journalist Dima Sadek continues to sting Nasrallah:\n\n(The war) is not so that we will pray in Jerusalem? \ud83e\udd14\n\n##\n(On all the posters of the Hezbollah victims it is written that they are \"martyrs on the way to Jerusalem\"...)"}, {"id": "13763444-2f27-474b-8a53-415caedd08ff", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32060/", "date": "2024-08-07 15:30", "message": "Hezbollah announces a death in its ranks:\n\nHassan Jeshi from the village of Jouaiyya \n\nHe was killed in an IDF attack this morning on his motorcycle \ud83d\udc46\n\nAccording to the IDF spokesman, he was a commander in the field of anti-tank missiles.\n\nNumber 401"}, {"id": "2ff85734-4c04-4257-a370-f56c77820103", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32060/", "date": "2024-08-07 15:22", "message": "At Abu Hajab's funeral, there was a lot of shooting in the air by the Jenin terrorists, as usual.\nAt the end of the attached video, the participants shout that someone has been hurt...\n\nIt was Samer Satiti, who was wounded by the shooting at the funeral and... also died of his wounds..."}, {"id": "cc1eeaac-840e-4fc4-b278-5fc6cb769d39", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/heb72807/", "date": "2024-08-07 15:20", "message": "This is the terrorist Mohammad Abu Hajab from Jenin.\n\nHe was injured yesterday in the IDF drone attack in Jenin.\nThis morning he died of his wounds.\nAs befits a respected terrorist, a well-attended funeral was held for him today in Jenin \ud83d\udc47"}, {"id": "2336d144-e3db-4c10-a529-03382ccd4e95", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32054/", "date": "2024-08-07 15:17", "message": "Northeast Syria: The Arab tribes are approaching al-Omar oil field, where American forces are located.\n\nThe rapid advance of the Arab tribes in Deir ez-Zur today, at the expense of the Kurds, should be very troubling to the Americans.\nThe Arab tribes are within touching distance of a strategic point - the Omar oil field (marked with a red circle on the map, inside the yellow area controlled, for the time being, by the Kurds, who are supported by the Americans).\nRed asterisks mark villages that, according to claims by Syrian sources, are from the Assad regime, and were captured this morning by the Arab tribes.\nThe attached video shows the refining facilities of the Omar oil field - documented by one of the Arab tribesmen.\n\nThe Americans should intervene."}, {"id": "4ea9fa97-e941-4ed6-a6f4-ee78248b0e11", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32051/", "date": "2024-08-07 15:13", "message": "The Ukrainian army launched an attack in Kursk, 15 km deep in Russia.\nThe Ukrainian vehicles are advancing with protective structures against drones."}, {"id": "4bc00bad-2be3-4905-81ce-a1362b3e21eb", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32060/", "date": "2024-08-07 15:11", "message": "Gazans in the central camps taking the fruits and vegetables from the supply trucks that make their way to their brothers in the north of the Gaza Strip."}, {"id": "b13a3ea8-a743-4778-847e-8ccfe67e5c19", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32047/", "date": "2024-08-07 13:20", "message": "Jordan: A grandson was born to King Abdullah of Jordan from his son, the heir to the throne.\nThe crown prince and his wife left the hospital today after the birth."}, {"id": "19356f74-1455-450b-b786-ba591fae2ab9", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/heb72807/", "date": "2024-08-07 13:16", "message": "Hassan Jeshi and the hookah in better days..."}, {"id": "257824aa-f61e-47c3-8028-4247fadece57", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32060/", "date": "2024-08-07 13:16", "message": "IDF: The IAF struck in the area of Jouaiyya, southern Lebanon, and eliminated the Hezbollah terrorist Hassan Fares Jeshi, who operated as a commander in Hezbollah's anti-tank missile unit. \n\nFurthermore, earlier today, the IAF struck Hezbollah military structures in the area of Aitaroun.
