hours of Wednesday morning.\nHamas, in its statement, vowed to avenge the cowardly assassination of its leader, who it stated \"passed as a result of a treacherous Zionist raid\" in the Iranian capital.\nHe is the second high-profile Hamas leader to be assassinated by the Israeli regime since Operation Al-Aqsa Storm on October 7, 2023, after Salah al-Arouri's assassination in southern Beirut on January 2.\nHaniyeh also served as the Hamas leader in the besieged Gaza Strip between 2006 and 2017, after which he was replaced by Yahya Sinwar, a high-ranking Hamas military commander.\nOn November 1, 2023, Haniyeh denounced the Israeli regime for committing \"barbaric massacres against unarmed civilians\" after a dastardly attack on the Jabalia refugee camp."}, {"id":
