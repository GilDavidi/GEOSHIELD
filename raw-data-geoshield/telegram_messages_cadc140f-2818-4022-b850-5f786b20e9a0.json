Hamas also published a list of 12 children it claims were killed in the attack.\n\nWhat are the following conclusions?\n1. When Israel does PR right, Hamas goes on the defensive.

Hamas pretends to have extensive knowledge of the names of the casualties and the circumstances of their death. Why don't they publish the complete list of all 40 dead? Why hide?

It appears that Hamas is more concerned about its public image. By not publishing these names, it maintains ambiguity with which it can accuse Israel of targeting civilians in schools / shelters / hospitals. \n\nEven Hezbollah does not behave this way.
