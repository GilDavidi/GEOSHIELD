As a result, the crossing remains closed even though Israel is ready to open it for the entry of goods and aid from Egypt.\nLast night Ismail Haniyeh, the chairman of the political bureau of Hamas, stated that the movement is in direct contact with the \"Egyptian brothers\" on this issue.\nEgypt is in an interesting trap that will only get worse as time passes and the crossing remains closed.
