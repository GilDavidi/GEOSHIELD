Allah will bring about a victory that is near thanks to the military activists. Victory and freedom for our prisoners are near.\n\nThe hunger in Gaza and especially in the north of the Gaza Strip that we see in the photos coming from the Gaza Strip rests on the shoulders of the international community and especially on the countries that support the murderous occupation.\n\nThe solution to the situation in Gaza will come through negotiations on a comprehensive agreement. Hamas is serious about this.\n\n##\nHaniyeh presents a militant line. He talks about the defeat of the enemy, about an imminent victory and congratulates the people of Gaza for their firm stand. This is in fact the narrative that the Palestinian media outlets are pumping from morning to evening, using quotes taken from the Israeli media.
