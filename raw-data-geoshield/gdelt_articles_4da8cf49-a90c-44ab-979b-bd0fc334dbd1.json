typically recover from wildfire in three to five yearsThe fire might be out but the devastating effects of the 2023 Bush Creek East wildfire continue to pose a threat.\nTwo senior geoscientists with BGC Engineering, Carie-Ann Hancock and Kris Holm, presented a post-wildfire geohazard risk assessment to Columbia Shuswap Regional District directors at the August board meeting in Salmon Arm.\nHancock described debris flows as concrete that moves at the speed of a car, and is very fast and very destructive.\nBoth debris flows and debris floods are more likely to occur following a fire and can cause severe damage to buildings or any kind of structure that exists on the landscape.\n\u201cThese debris flows often have very little warning before they occur, so within minutes of a high intensity rainstorm you can suddenly get debris coming down very fast into housing and occupied areas,\u201d she said, pointing out the flows can transport huge boulders and logs."}, {"id":
