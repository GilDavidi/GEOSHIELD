region kill at least 113 minutesBy Max HunderKHARKIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Russia struck a busy lakeside resort on the edge of Ukraine\u2019s second largest city on Sunday and attacked villages in the surrounding region, killing at least 11 people and wounding scores.\nThe missile strikes were the latest in what have been constant Russian attacks in recent weeks on the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine, where Russian troops have launched an offensive.\nRussian forces pushed their way into northern areas of Kharkiv region last week and the Russian military says they have captured at least 12 villages.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy again called on Western allies to supply Kyiv with additional air defence systems to protect Kharkiv and other cities.\nAir defence systems for other cities and sufficient support for soldiers on the front line would ensure Russia\u2019s defeat, the president added."}, {"id": "d7d98d27-557e-4022-a01d-7f7b8c6cc581", "title": "At least 11
