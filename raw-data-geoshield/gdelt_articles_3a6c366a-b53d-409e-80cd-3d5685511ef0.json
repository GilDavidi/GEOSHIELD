Ismail Haniyeh, there have been differing reports by Hamas and Iran regarding how he was killed, according to a Saturday report by the Arabic news outlet Al-Araby.\nKhaled Qaddoumi, Hamas's representative in Tehran, said that the assassination occurred through the targeting of Haniyeh's room with an \"aerial projectile,\" citing the explosion's impact on the room.\n\"The appearance of the place after the attack and the condition of the martyred leader Ismail Haniyeh's body clearly indicate that the targeting was by an aerial projectile, whether a missile or a shell.\"\nQaddoumi's remarks were consistent with what Khalil al-Hayya, senior head of Hamas in Gaza, stated in a press conference on Wednesday, hours after Haniyeh's assassination.\nThe Al-Araby report concluded that \"In the absence of a comprehensive official narrative, the execution of Ismail Haniyeh's assassination remains mysterious, despite the known identity of the perpetrators.\""}, {"id":
