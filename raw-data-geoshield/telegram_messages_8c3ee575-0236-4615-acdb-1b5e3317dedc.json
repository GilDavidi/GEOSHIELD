That is, it can be roughly estimated that al-Mimadani al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City recieved 40-50 dead from the attack on the school (of which the names of about 30 dead were published on several channels).\n\nThe Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza is trying to juggle two weddings here - on the one hand to try and continue to maintain credibility and on the other hand to help Hamas establish the lie that there were 100 dead in the school without \"dirtying its hands\" with a \"miscount\".\n\nOtherwise there is really no explanation as to why the ministry chose to consolidate a report of two days and declare the number of dead who did not arrive at the hospitals, which is contrary to the practice followed until now."}, {"id": "7bc0132c-36dc-41da-90c4-e94c1f8cb2ba", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32286/", "date": "2024-08-12 09:55", "message": "There is a very simple way to solve this problem:)"}, {"id": "5b5ec73d-3bb3-48f0-ac1d-95bc023b9d13", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32285/", "date": "2024-08-12 09:53", "message": "Further to the billboard \ud83d\udc46 that was hung yesterday in Palestine Square in Tehran and further to the Hamas statement regarding the lack of interest in further negotiations that was published last night, the Iranians (and Hamas) are trying to promote a narrative that Israel made a mistake in the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh because, according to them, he was a \"moderating factor\" in the leadership of Hamas and now Israel needs to face the \"militant Sinwar\"."}, {"id": "1bf29a27-6df0-41b7-a74a-864cd5e4981f", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en32284/", "date": "2024-08-12 08:57", "message": "Residents of the Issawiya neighborhood in East Jerusalem report that \"captain Kadosh\" (nickname for who writes these notices -AA) from the Israeli Shin Bet left them flyers in which he warns against the increasing terrorism and incitement in the neighborhood.
