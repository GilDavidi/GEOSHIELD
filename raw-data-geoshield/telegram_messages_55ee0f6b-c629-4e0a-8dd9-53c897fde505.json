First and foremost, Hamas will continue to harden positions in the negotiations. something that would make it difficult to end the war.\n\n2. Israel's enemies are seeing that Israel is left on its own. The next significant attack on Israel is being built right now. Biden gave the green light for this in such interviews.\n\n3. Other allies of the US in the Middle East will look at the US as a broken reed. Who would want an alliance with a country that abandons its most important ally in one of its most challenging moments and abandons it in front of the whole world? If I were the ruler of Saudi Arabia, I would reconsider my strategic relations and look for alternatives. And this isn't even the first time the US has done so - in recent years, the US has shown several times a despicable abandonment of its allies in the Middle East. Ask all the Afghani nationals that were running for their lives for fear of the Taliban, or Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the reliability of America as an ally...\n\nBiden is speaking to his home audience, to the leaders of \"Gaza camps\" at universities in the US in order to win votes for the upcoming elections, all while leading to more violence in the Middle East in the long run."}, {"id": "573a9daf-f0b3-4878-9c3d-eed43c4f2a7b", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26934/", "date": "2024-05-09 05:37", "message": "President Biden in an interview with CNN:\n\nI made it clear.
