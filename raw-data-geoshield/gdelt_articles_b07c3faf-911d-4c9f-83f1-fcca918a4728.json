avoidance and sea rescue capabilities among other systems, a source familiar with the matter told CNA Sunday.\nThe planned overhaul of the Air Force's existing 20 C-130s is scheduled to take place from 2025 to 2030.\nTaiwan's Air Force first bought 20 C-130Hs and another C-130HE, a modified electronic warfare aircraft, from the United States in the early 1980s.\nThe force lost one of its 20 C-130H, serial number 1310, in a 1997 crash at Taipei Songshan Airport.\nThe Air Force C-130 fleet currently has a total of 20 such models that serve as the main transporter aircraft for the nation's
