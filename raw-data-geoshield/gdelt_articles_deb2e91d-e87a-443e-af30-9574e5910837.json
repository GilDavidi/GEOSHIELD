AMMAN - Prime Bisher Khasawneh on Saturday said that Jordan has a scarcity of natural resources but possesses a \"distinctive human wealth\".\nHe highlighted that part of the unemployment rate in Jordan is due to the culture of leaning towards the public sector, which can no longer generate job opportunities.\nThe prime minister pointed out that the private sector bore a lot during the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of closures, and that Jordanians crafted the economic reform programme to combat tax evasion.\nKhasawneh stressed that Jordan's economic growth targets would have reached 2.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, but the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip resulted in achieving a rate of 2.6 per cent.\nHe pointed out that the inflation rate in Jordan is 1.6 per
