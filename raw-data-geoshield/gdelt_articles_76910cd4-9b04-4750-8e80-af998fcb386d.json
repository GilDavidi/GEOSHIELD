"Protestors rally against AUKUS nuclear-powered submarines in SydneyXinhua) 11:10, August 05, 2024SYDNEY, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- Some dozens of protestors, including members from the local activist group Sydney Anti-AUKUS Coalition, gathered at the Sydney Town Hall Square on Saturday to demand that the Australian government reject the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarines.\nPeter Murphy, convenor of Sydney Anti-AUKUS Coalition, said in his speech at the rally that the AUKUS Pact between the United States, Britain and Australia was a super-secret project to have Australia acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines, as well as to jointly develop hypersonic missiles, cyber warfare, quantum computing and Artificial Intelligence weapons.\nThe protestors marched to the Defence Plaza Sydney after the gathering, with banners that read, \"Australia says No to AUKUS, No to NATO, No to War\", \"Down with the AUKUS Nuclear Submarine Deal,\" \"Scrap AUKUS Now\" and \"No to Nuclear Subs.\"\nDennis Doherty, co-ordinator of Sydney Anti-AUKUS Coalition, told Xinhua that the nuclear industry, the nuclear weapons and the nuclear submarines will have a negative impact on Australia.\nAnd that's why it's a bad move to have nuclear-powered submarines, because it's a threatening move which will increase tension in our region when we need to decrease tension,\" he said."}, {"id":
