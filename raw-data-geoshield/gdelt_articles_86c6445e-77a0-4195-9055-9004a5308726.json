town of Abasan, south of the Gaza Strip.Medical sources said that eight Palestinians were martyred after Israeli warplanes bombed a tent housing displaced persons near the Abu Hawa brick factory in Abasan al-Kabira, east of Khan Younis.Four were martyred and others were wounded in a bombing that targeted a house and a popular market west of Khan Younis.Meanwhile, the Civil Defense said that three Palestinians were martyred in an Israeli raid near al-Shafi'i Mosque west of the city, and 10 others were wounded.Three were also martyred in a bombing of a tent in the town of Bani Suhaila, east of the city, and a woman was killed in an Israeli raid on a charitable soup kitchen distributing food to the displaced.Israel and Hamas are still close to a ceasefire deal, the White House insisted yesterday, despite growing fears of a regional war following the assassination of a key Hamas leader.AFP said Washington is still engaged in \"intense diplomacy\" to prevent further escalation after Iran threatened revenge for the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\"We are as close as we think we have ever been\" to a deal for a Gaza ceasefire and the release of hostages, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.Israel's ambulance service has stocked blood supplies in a fortified underground centre, factories have moved out hazardous materials and municipal authorities are checking bomb shelters and water supplies as the country waits for a threatened attack from Iran and its proxies.\nThey are also being equipped with generators.A number of underground parking lots have been approved as makeshift shelters with enough space for thousands of residents if needed, Zilberman said.In the city of Ramla in central Israel, national ambulance service Magen David Adom (MDA) has been collecting blood donations in a subterranean service center, shielded with extra-thick concrete walls, blast doors and airlocks.Last Thursday, the Environmental Protection Ministry held a situational assessment to decide how best to protect factories with inventories that could be dangerous if targeted in a missile strike, or how to deal with an attack on a building that contains asbestos.The military said the Home Front Command keeps in constant contact with factories and local authorities to maintain a \"complete picture of the inventory levels of hazardous materials\".The Bazan Group, which operates in Haifa one of the largest oil refineries in the eastern Mediterranean, told Reuters it was \"working to maintain energy
