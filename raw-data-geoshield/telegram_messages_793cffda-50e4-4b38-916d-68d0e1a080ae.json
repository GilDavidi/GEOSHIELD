I mean, it strongly condemned it...\n\nBut if we dig a little deeper, translate it into \"spoken Middle Eastern\", and read between the lines\u00a0- there\u00a0is no threat of concrete actions from the Egyptian side, no threat to trade\u00a0agreements,\u00a0or diplomatic relations, and certainly not to the peace agreements between the two countries.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEgypt calls on Israel to exercise maximum restraint...\u00a0This\u00a0translates to - When you take down Hamas in Rafah, do it in a way that won't make us look bad. After all, we're not really doing anything to prevent you from doing so, but we still need to maintain our image as one of the leading countries in the Arab world...\n\nThe al-Sisi regime, which despises the Muslim Brotherhood and its Palestinian branch - Hamas, would be more than happy to see Hamas disappear from its border.\n\nMeanwhile, there are quite a few complaints among Gazans on social media: Where has the Egyptian army gone? They're doing nothing to prevent Israel from acting in Rafah...\n\n##\nTo summarize,\u00a0the Egyptians are not that excited,\u00a0and\u00a0Hamas has not stopped the ceasefire talks.\u00a0Now we understand just how idle all the threats to prevent a military operation in Rafah were.\n\nThis\u00a0is an\u00a0important\u00a0lesson for the coming months of the war."}, {"id": "1f8730cb-dcb0-4ad8-9b3c-319f0248b698", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26850/", "date": "2024-05-07 10:20", "message": "The movement of displaced Gazans from Rafah to Khan Yunis continues...\n\nSome of the displaced people who left Rafah today are setting up tents near the ruins of their homes in Khan Yunis."}, {"id": "7518559f-edcb-4880-a206-bb882cea0ac4", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26849/", "date": "2024-05-07 10:09", "message": "More ridicule from Fatah-affiliated channels: \"Be quite!\"\n\nAttached is an old photo of the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Yahya Sinwar, in his good old days in an Israeli prison."}, {"id": "be63f0e1-0af2-47e7-a72d-accc2ce0a944", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26848/", "date": "2024-05-07 10:08", "message": "Fatah-affiliated channels are mocking Hamas:\n\nWhere have all the Hamas police officers gone?\nWhere are they?
