wounded in a bombing that targeted a house and a popular market west of Khan Younis.Meanwhile, the Civil Defense said that three Palestinians were martyred in an Israeli raid near al-Shafi'i Mosque west of the city, and 10 others were wounded.Three were also martyred in a bombing of a tent in the town of Bani Suhaila, east of the city, and a woman was killed in an Israeli raid on a charitable

to decide how best to protect factories with inventories that could be dangerous if targeted in a missile strike, or how to deal with an attack on a building that contains asbestos.The military said the Home Front Command keeps in constant contact with factories and local authorities to maintain a \"complete picture of the inventory levels of hazardous materials\".The Bazan Group, which operates
