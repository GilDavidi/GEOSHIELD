Storm Debby will impact the Tampa Bay areaFactors impacting storm surgeThe NHC said storm surge is sensitive to the slightest changes and can be impacted by several factors.\nStorm intensity- Higher wind speeds = Higher storm surgeForward speed- Faster storm = Higher surge at coastline, Slower storm = Surge goes further inlandSize- Larger storm = Higher surgeAngle of Approach- Perpendicular to coast = Higher storm surge, Parallel or oblique = lower storm surgeWidth and Slope of Ocean Bottom- Wide, gentle slope = Higher storm surge, Narrow, steep slope = Lower storm surgeShape of Coastline-
