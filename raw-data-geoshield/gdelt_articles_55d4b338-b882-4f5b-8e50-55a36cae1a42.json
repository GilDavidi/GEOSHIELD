strike inside Russia to counter coming Russian attacks in the Kharkov region, it has since used Western weapons to attack targets irrelevant to the special military operation.Over the past week, Ukraine claimed that it struck two Russian early warning radar systems designed to detect long-range ballistic missile attacks, including nuclear strikes.\nNeither system that was targeted was turned toward Ukrainian territory, which seems to implicate an alternative motive than affecting the Ukrainian theater.The attack represented a significant escalation of the conflict and came as NATO countries toyed with the idea of sending their troops to Ukraine to fill Kiev\u2019s manpower shortage.Since Russia has proven more than capable of defeating NATO equipment and tactics on the battlefield, it has little reason to fear a conventional land war against NATO countries in Ukraine, but that could easily spiral into a nuclear war which forces any rational actor to behave with caution.\u201cNATO representatives, especially in Europe, should be aware of what they are playing with,\u201d Putin said at a press conference in Uzbekistan on Tuesday.Western countries don\u2019t fear allowing Kiev to strike inside of Russia because they already have and those countries didn\u2019t suffer any significant consequences, noted Sleboda.On Wednesday, the Head of the Delegation of the Russian Federation to the Vienna Negotiations on Military Security and Arms Control, Konstantin Gavrilov warned that \u201cA potential aggressor needs to realize that, if attacked, we reserve the right to act \u2018as the situation demands,\u2019 so to speak, and use all our capabilities,\u201d adding that any response to violating Russian redlines \u201cmay be truly devastating.\u201dWith its numerous successes on the battlefield over the past several months Russia has no reason to seek escalation, but Western countries continue to try to provoke Russia into a wider war despite the consequences it could hold for all of civilization.A recent study by Nature estimated that a nuclear war between the United States and Russia would result in around 5 billion deaths worldwide.\nhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20240528/poland-not-excluding-sending-troops-to-ukraine-in-future---foreign-ministry-1118662023.htmlrussiaukrainekievSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com

war cabinet.\n\"We are now in the fifth month of 2024, which means we expect another seven months of fighting to deepen our achievements and achieve our goal of destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,\" Hanegbi stated.These remarks come as Israeli tanks, spotted in central Rafah for the first time since the operation commenced, continued to advance on the southern Gaza city on Wednesday.\nThis action persists despite mounting global pressure to halt the offensive , as reported by CNN.Initially, the Israeli government suggested that entering Rafah would mark the final stage of its war against Hamas, which initiated attacks on Israel in October, resulting in approximately 1,200 casualties and the abduction of around 250 individuals.\nHe urged patience and resilience, cautioning against setting ultimatums, according to CNN.Meanwhile, Israel persists with its military offensive despite growing global outrage, triggered by an Israeli airstrike on Sunday that killed at least 45 people and injured 200 others in Rafah at a camp for displaced people, previously designated as a safe zone.Footage from the Tal al-Sultan camp depicted scenes of horror, with charred bodies extracted from rubble and a man holding the headless body of a child amidst raging fires.Despite calls for reconsideration, US President Joe Biden has maintained his stance on Israel, indicating that the Rafah strike had not yet crossed a red line warranting alterations in American support.The strike occurred shortly after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to \"immediately halt\" its offensive in Rafah or any actions exacerbating conditions for Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe ICJ described the humanitarian situation in

aerial combat training exercise, aimed at integrating aircrew in a multinational environment,\u201d an IAF officer said.The IAF has taken part in the Red Flag exercise, which is considered to be the most realistic air combat exercise with fighter pilots honing their skills with thousands of targets, realistic threat systems and an opposing enemy force, two times in the past.Over 100 aircraft from four nations, along with around 3,100 personnel to fly, operate and maintain them, will take part in this edition of the Red Flag exercise from June 1 to June 14.\u201cRed Flag-Alaska is designed to provide realistic training in a simulated combat environment, enabling joint combined forces to exchange tactics, techniques and procedures while improving interoperability with fellow service members,\u201d the USAF said.\u201cThe training spans from individual skills to complex, large-scale joint engagements.\nThe exercises can be adapted to integrate various forces into a realistic threat environment using the more than 77,000 square miles of airspace in the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex, which is the largest combat training range in the world,\u201d it added.The IAF has been regularly participating in air combat exercises with other countries.\nThese include multi-nation exercises like the 'Iniochos' in Greece, the 'Orion' in France, 'Blue Flag' in Israel, 'Pitch
