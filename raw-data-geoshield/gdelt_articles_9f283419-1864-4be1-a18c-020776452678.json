BYSTRICA, Slovakia (AP) \u2014 Slovakia\u2019s populist Prime Minister Robert Fico was shot multiple times and gravely wounded Wednesday, but his deputy prime minister said he believed Fico would survive.\nThe prime minister had been greeting supporters at an event when the attempted assassination took place, shocking the small country and reverberating across Europe weeks before an election.\nA suspect was in custody, and an initial investigation found \u201ca clear political motivation\u201d behind the assassination attempt, Interior Minister Matus Sutaj Estok said as he briefed reporters alongside the defense minister.\nKicking off his fourth term as prime minister, his government halted arms deliveries to Ukraine, and critics worry that he will lead Slovakia \u2014 a nation of 5.4 million that belongs to NATO \u2014 to abandon its pro-Western course and follow in the footsteps of Hungary under populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\nBut politics as usual were put aside as the nation faced the shock of the attempt on Fico\u2019s life."}, {"id": "9a16910a-778d-4ea7-ad21-0e382d2a3f9a", "title": "China is quietly building the world first drone carrier",
