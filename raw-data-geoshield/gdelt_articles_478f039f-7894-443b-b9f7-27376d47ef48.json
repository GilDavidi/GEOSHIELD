the war for his own political reasons, Biden said: \"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\n\"Biden, who has been pushing for an end to the nearly eight-month war, also said it was \"uncertain\" whether Israeli forces have committed war crimes in Gaza.He rejected allegations that Israel is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, but said: \"I think they've engaged

mistake,\" he said.Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer, asked about the interview, said it was \"outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country\" for Biden to make such comments about Netanyahu.Last month, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor in The Hague requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense chief, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged war crimes.Opinion polls show most Israelis support the war but blame Netanyahu for the security failures when Hamas gunmen rampaged through Israeli communities near Gaza on Oct. 7, and would vote him out if there were an election.Mass street protests have become weekly events, drawing tens of thousands demanding the government do more to bring home hostages seized by Hamas in Oct. 7 and calling for
