Only the release of the hostages?\u00a0\nWhy is Hamas's list so long and marketed so well? Each such demand line from Hamas is published and reiterated non-stop by officials and representatives, which only strengthens each of the demands individually as bargaining chips in the negotiations. Israel has to give something to meet each of Hamas's long list of demands.\n\nDoes Israel only want the release of hostages? That's it? Why?\n\nOver the past few months, the US has been urging Israel to make decisions on \"the day after the war.\" This was crucial to them. Israel was publicly reprimanded, even creating internal political conflict.\n\nNow, the time has come for Israel to turn to the Americans, who are urging it with all their might to reach an agreement and ask about the day after the war.\n\nWhat will happen to senior Hamas officials? What will happen to Hamas's weapons?\n\nJust as Hamas announces several times a day in every possible media outlet that its threshold condition for a deal is a permanent ceasefire, Israel should now demand as a threshold condition for any future agreement the removal of senior Hamas officials from the Strip and the disarmament of Hamas.\n\nThis is a logical, basic, important condition, one that the US will have a hard time saying no to, which can lead to the full and real end of the war, even if the IDF does not eliminate all of Hamas's militants in the Strip (complete elimination is probably an unrealistic goal).\n\nSuch a condition would prevent Hamas from claiming victory. The winners are never exiled.\n\nThe US can and should agree to such a condition - it will allow it to create new leadership in Gaza for the day after the war. As long as senior Hamas officials are not expelled from the Strip and as long as Hamas is not disarmed, it is irrelevant to talk about \"the day after\" in the Strip.\n\nHamas will not just peacefully allow a foreign power (Israel, the US, Saudi Arabia, or anyone else...) to replace them as the ruling force in the Gaza Strip with someone else. The exile of Hamas's leaders is a necessary step, as mentioned, towards ending the war.\n\nIsrael should start demanding that the exile of Hamas and its disarmament are threshold conditions for any future ceasefire deal! Only then can we commit to ending the war, and it would even help Biden reach a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia before the November elections..."}, {"id": "a9fc5acd-abf2-465f-a619-662b444f4e2c", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26853/", "date": "2024-05-07 12:01", "message": "Hamas in an official announcement: the purpose of the (Israeli) invasion into Rafah is to harm the ceasefire efforts.\n\n###\nAnd they still aren't announcing the suspension of talks, as they promised they would if Israel were to invade Rafah."}, {"id": "1d88392b-0406-4c9c-8ae4-c465d14d6204", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26852/", "date": "2024-05-07 10:45", "message": "Palestinian channels: An Israeli drone punched a hole in the dome of the Al-Abrar Mosque in the center of Rafah."}, {"id": "9b507c4b-2eb3-4338-8395-29df3fcec171", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26851/", "date": "2024-05-07 10:42", "message": "The Egyptian Foreign Ministry condemns the operation in Rafah.
