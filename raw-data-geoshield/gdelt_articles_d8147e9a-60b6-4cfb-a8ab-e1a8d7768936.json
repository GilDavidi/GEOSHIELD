Spain's drought-hit Costa Blanca, people queue for bottled waterFollow on Published On: Wed, 21 Aug 2024 21:13:02 PKTTEULADA-MORAIRA, Spain (Reuters) - A severe drought has rendered tap water undrinkable in several towns along Spain's Costa Blanca, forcing holidaymakers and locals to queue at distribution points for bottled water to cover their basic needs.\nAs water levels have dropped, salinity has increased, prompting authorities in some areas to deem tap water unsafe for drinking or cooking.\nBottled water is being distributed free of charge.\nThe lack of water has forced town councils to ban activities such as filling swimming pools, or watering gardens and washing cars during the daytime.\nTraditionally, Valencians attribute the local paella's distinct flavour to the mineral-rich hard water on tap there."}, {"id": "66e02854-b23c-421c-bb0c-475338453f20", "title": "Watch : Connecticut home collapses amid historic flooding", "date": "2024-08-21 03:15", "url":
