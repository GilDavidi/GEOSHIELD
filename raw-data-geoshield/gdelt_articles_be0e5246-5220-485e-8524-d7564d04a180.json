member of the Oxford Action for Palestine (OA4P) press team spoke exclusively to Cherwell at the protest outside the Sheldonian Theatre on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe interview covered topics including OA4P\u2019s response to last week\u2019s arrests, their demands for the University, and their future plans.\nWhen asked about the organisation\u2019s future plans, the spokesperson told Cherwell OA4P demands that: \u201cthe Vice-Chancellor meets our demands and meets us for negotiations.\nThat is our number one priority.\u201d They explained that future actions by the group will \u201call depend on her [the Vice-Chancellor\u2019s] complicity and her silence\u2026if she responds, we\u2019re willing to meet with her.\u201dThe spokesperson continued: \u201cOA4P is not just the encampment\u2026we\u2019re not stopping until we meet,\u201d explaining that the organisation has long-term plans in place \u201cbecause we do want our demands to be met in part of our tenures here.\u201dRegarding the University\u2019s response to their protests, the spokesperson told Cherwell: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that we have not been satisfied with any of the responses from the University, particularly the University calling the police on our protestors last week.\u201d Speaking more directly in relation to the arrests of 16 students last week after a sit-in in University offices, they described the police\u2019s response as \u201cbrutalisation\u201d, calling the University \u201cignorant, complicit, and scapegoating [the protestors].\u201d The spokesperson said that this response has \u201conly fueled the fire in terms of how we [OA4P] act [going] forward.\u201dFocusing on the reasons for the protest this afternoon, the spokesperson described how \u201cthere are no universities left in Gaza while congregation meets\u2026 our aim today is to support the faculty members who are bravely standing up against the genocide in Gaza.\u201d They continued: \u201ca lot of the questions being asked in the congregation has to do with divestment, not only in the genocide in Gaza, but largely in illgeal arms manufacturing\u201d, describing the event as \u201ca continuation against the genocide in Gaza.\u201dIn response to the arrests of OA4P protestors during their occupation of the Oxford University offices last week, they said that \u201cprotestors did not go into a peaceful sit-in expecting to be arrested.\u201d However, she acknowledged the risks some protestors face, saying: \u201cwe have continuously advocated for people to assess their own risk levels, and whilst doing so acknowledge that we are the privileged ones, and that we are willing to use our time and resources if it means that we can help alleviate the genocide in Gaza.\u201dThe spokesperson declined to comment on the allegations that some members of the encampment had used antisemitic language towards some Jewish Oxford Students, in relation to the St Hugh\u2019s JCR Vice-President\u2019s resignation a few days prior.\nHowever, another member of OA4Ps press team pointed out that an open letter was sent by \u201csenior Jewish professors\u201d at the University,
