of California Santa Cruz, May 20, 2024Are you a UC academic worker?\nTo join the fight for rank-and-file committees and the expansion of the UC strike, fill out the form at the end of this article.\nThe strikebreaking order issued by a California judge last Friday has provoked broad opposition from University of California academic workers, who are determined to continue their historic walkout to stop the US-backed genocide in Gaza and the police crackdown on campus protests.\nUnder immense pressure from rank-and-file workers, however, the UAW has not made any public statements as of this writing on whether it will bow to the illegitimate injunction.\nThis means breaking the information blackout on the UC strike by the UAW apparatus, which has done nothing to inform UAW members about the decisive struggle."}, {"id": "6c708d6a-d943-4dcf-b73e-9b2302f2b1bd", "title": "Slovak PM suffers shock election defeat after assassination bid", "date": "2024-06-10 03:15", "url":
