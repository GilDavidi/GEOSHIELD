May 2024 6:32 AMIraqi anti-terror resistance groups have launched a drone strike against a strategic target in the southernmost part of the 1948 Israeli-occupied territories in support of Palestinians, who are subjected to the Tel Aviv regime's unrelenting onslaught against Gaza.\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of anti-terror fighters, in a statement published on its Telegram channel, claimed responsibility for the attack on the \"vital\" site in the Port of Eilat early on Sunday.\nThe group noted that it will continue to target and destroy important installations across the occupied lands.\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq has been staging many such attacks on Israeli targets since the occupying regime launched a genocidal war on Gaza in early October.\nAt least 35,386 Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children, and another 79,366 individuals have sustained injuries."}, {"id": "5c980542-40df-4174-a3d5-ef008a78556e", "title": "Helicopter
