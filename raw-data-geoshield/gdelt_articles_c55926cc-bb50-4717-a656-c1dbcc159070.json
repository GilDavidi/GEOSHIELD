he is getting all the necessary help,\u201d the company said on X.Residential houses, shops and more than a dozen cars were also damaged in the attack, according to the interior minister\u2019s post on Telegram.\u201cRussia will be held accountable for this terror,\u201d Zelensky said in a post on Telegram.Ukraine\u2019s offensive into the Kursk region appeared to catch Russia off guard.Influential Russian military bloggers have blasted army leaders for failing to spot or quash the incursion.Senior Ukrainian officials have not commented although Zelensky alluded to the attack on Thursday.\u201cEveryone can see that the Ukraine army knows how to surprise and knows how to achieve results,\u201d he said.Moscow has not presented detailed information on the extent of the advance.It said yesterday that it had struck Ukrainian positions on the western edge of Sudzha, a town around 8km (five miles) from the border that appeared to be the focus of Kyiv\u2019s offensive.Several Russian media shared a video purporting to show Sudzha residents appealing to President Vladimir Putin for help, warning that many were unable to evacuate.\u201cIn a few hours our town was turned into ruins ... our relatives are left behind, we can\u2019t call them, there is no communication.\nPlease help us get our land back,\u201d one resident said in the video.Thousands have been evacuated from the border region, with Russia putting on an extra train to Moscow from the regional capital, Kursk.At a train station in Moscow, AFP journalists saw families disembarking with children.\u201cThe war has come to us, so all the relatives have gone to Moscow,\u201d AFP heard a woman with her young daughter saying at the station.\u201cUkrainian forces are reportedly present in areas as far as 35km from the international border,\u201d said the independent US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in its daily assessment drawing on geolocated videos and photos.However, those troops \u201cmost certainly do not control\u201d that entire area, it added.Putin has called the incursion a \u201clarge-scale provocation\u201d by Kyiv, and Russia\u2019s top general has vowed to crush it.On the first day of the assault, Kursk regional governor Alexei Smirnov said five civilians had been killed.The health ministry said on Thursday that 66 people had been wounded.Twelve were hospitalised in a serious condition, it said yesterday.Yesterday Ukraine expanded its own evacuation zone in the Sumy region, just across the border from Kursk.\u201cAbout 20,000 people need to be evacuated\u201d from 28 settlements, Ukraine\u2019s police force said.Ukraine also said it had carried out a major air strike on a Russian military base in the Lipetsk region, around 280km (175 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border.It said it had struck \u201cwarehouses containing guided aerial bombs and a number of other facilities\u201d.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) i"}, {"id": "c4d5f895-c23e-4e9b-8bec-3a1922914fa9", "title": "Russia declares an emergency in Kursk region , under attack by Ukraine", "date": "2024-08-10 00:15", "url": "https://www.pressherald.com/2024/08/09/russia-declares-an-emergency-in-kursk-region-under-attack-by-ukraine/", "domain": "pressherald.com", "domain_classification": "Unknown", "message": "July saw the heaviest civilian casualties in Ukraine since October 2022, the U.N.
