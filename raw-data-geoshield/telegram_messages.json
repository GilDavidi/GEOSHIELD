This invites the next mass kidnapping. The next demand of Hamas in exchange for future abductees could be, for example, an Israeli withdrawl from Judea and Samaria. Where do we draw the line (literally)?\n\nSuch an error invites the next war. Israel does not have the privilege of losing the current war or of not winning decisively and perhaps later making amends. There will be no second chance here. This is a defining moment in which Israel's image will be determined in the eyes of its enemies and allies in the Middle East. Israeli captains should know how to say \"no\" and withstand pressure if the deal offered to them endangers the future of the State of Israel.\n\nI do not for a moment undermine the importance of the redemption of abductees and the critical commitment of the State of Israel towards its kidnapped citizens, at the same time the State of Israel has a commitment to the other 10 million of its citizens and to those who sacrificed their lives, bodies and souls for it.\nIsrael knew how to make a good deal in November. The release of dozens of hostages at an acceptable price does not create an image of victory for Hamas. Israel's captains should also know how to say no if the terms of the new deal are bad for its citizens.\n\nThe issue of visibility\n\nVisibility to the spectators in the stands of the Middle East is of crucial importance here. If Hamas is perceived as the winner following the upcoming deal, Israel will pay an unbearably high price in the lives of its citizens and in its future as a sovereign state in the near future. Hyenas have a developed sense of smell, they know when the prey is in a position of weakness. The rest of the clan will arrive with phenomenal speed.\n\nThe Palestinians refer to October 7th as \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0648\u0631 \"crossing day\" - the day they crossed from the Gaza Strip into \"Occupied Palestine\". October 6th was also called by the Egyptians by the exact same name - \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0648\u0631 - Day of Crossing, the day they \"crossed the canal\" in 1973.\nHezbollah also uses the same terminology when talking about its military plans against Israel. If Hamas is perceived as the winner, the next crossing day (the third) is around the corner.\n\nAnd that's before we even touch on the consequences that will follow the throwing into the fray of hundreds of serious and especially talented perpetrators of terrorism who are supposed to be released as part of such a deal. The security establishment has already proven in the past that it cannot deal with the consequences of releasing such a large amount of serious terrorists. This is a massive amount of actors that can change the reality on the ground.\n\nThe decision makers must be publicly accountable to the citizens of Israel before they make such consequential decisions. This cannot be done in the dark. It is immoral."}, {"id": "b23a8c61-c477-4f12-86c9-0f8935db547c", "channel_id": 1560386984, "date": "2024-04-29 21:02", "message": "What are the consequences of stopping the war as part of a deal before the completion of the fighting in Rafah, Nuseirat and Deir al-Balah?\n\nHamas publicly and consistently demands the complete cessation of the war as a precondition for a hostage release deal or at the very least final, written and definitive guarantees on the matter.\n\nAccording to the latest reports in Arab and Israeli media, one gets the impression while reading between the lines that Hamas's demand to end the war was not outright rejected by the Israeli side.\n\nRegarding the matter, caution must be exercised because \"reports\" from negotiations about an upcoming deal always come with multiple spins with the aim of influencing the negotiations, so it is difficult to know how reliable they are.\n\nAt the same time, I will chose to now treat this possibility seriously, since this is an existential matter of supreme national importance concerning the continued existence of the State of Israel (no less!) in the Middle East. It is important to deeply understand the meaning derived from an Israeli agreement that would prevent the completion of the fighting in Rafah, Nuseirat and Deir Al-Balah.\n\nFirst I will describe the circumstances of the ongoing negotiations, which is also of crucial importance:\n\nIsrael is coming to the current negotiations from a position of inferiority, under unprecedented American, Western and international pressure. It was forced to accept, by dictation from the Americans and under public reprimands that echoed all over the Middle East and the world, a massive influx of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, unparalled in world history. Israel is under constant threat from the International Court of Justice in The Hague and suffers from a significant weakness in international public opinion.\nIsrael arrives at the negotiations when most of its maneuvering military forces are not in Gaza and only a small force remains inside, responsible for freezing the situation without carrying out significant offensive activity.\n\nOn the other hand, Hamas comes to the negotiations from a position of advantage and strength. It is receiving unprecedented global support. People across the West are calling for a \"Palestinian state from the river to the sea\" - something that is reflected on all television screens everywhere. The US is pressuring Israel to get closer and closer to the original Hamas position while Hamas bides its time - Israel's allies are doing the work for Hamas.\nHamas succeeds in igniting demonstrations on the issue of the abductees in the heart of the State of Israel by publishing videos, with the aim of exerting domestic pressure on the decision makers in Israel.\nThere is more, but we will summarize and say that it is very obvious that Hamas has the upper hand here in everything related to the management of the negotiations - something that was not the case in the November abductee deal. Then, Hamas came from a weaker position.\n\nThe meaning:\n\nRelinquishing operating in Rafah, Nizirat and Deir al-Balakhequates to Israel losing the war in practice. Prime Minister Netanyahu said this in his own voice several times.\n \nThe only solution I see for this to be seen otherwise, without this being considered a resounding Israeli loss, is the exile of all the leaders of Hamas and its military operatives within the framework of an agreement that includes their disarmament. If Israel gives up the occupation of Rafah, Nizirat and Deir al-Balah without expelling Hamas from the Gaza Strip and disarming it, this will affect the future and existence of the State of Israel in the Middle East.\n\nIsrael was hit on October 7th and its deterrence was severely damaged. If she does not correct this impression and does not present a convincing victory or complete destruction of the enemy, then the next October 7th is only a matter of time. And it will not be a long way off.\nIsrael is now fighting for its image and character and how it will be perceived in the jungle of the Middle East in the years to come."}, {"id": "5a59f332-4a90-46ae-b011-525a08325e8f", "channel_id": 1560386984, "date": "2024-04-29 20:35", "message": "The financial markets are smiling at the new president of Argentina:\nThe Argentine peso is the currency that jumped at the highest rate in the world against the dollar in the last 3 months (since Javier Milei was elected president of Argentina).\nThe Argentine currency strengthened by 25% during this period."}, {"id": "0d254ec9-e3ce-4876-b0e9-6b4c74589571", "channel_id": 1560386984, "date": "2024-04-29 20:34", "message": "Hamas: The movement's delegation arrived in Cairo today to consult and clarify a number of issues in the latest proposal.
