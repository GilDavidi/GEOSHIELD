airstrike outside the designated \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d Sunday night may have been caused by the secondary detonation of Hamas munitions located near a civilian safe zone, according to the

senior Hamas commanders Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, both previously involved in deadly attacks against Israelis and planning further attacks, based on intelligence reports.\nHamas\u2019 Judea and Samaria wing is responsible for the planning, funding, and carrying out of terror attacks throughout Judea and Samaria and within Israel.\nSome Israeli media claimed Hamas exploited Western
