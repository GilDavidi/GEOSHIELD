Hamas also published a list of 12 children it claims were killed in the attack.\n\nWhat are the following conclusions?\n1. When Israel does PR right, Hamas goes on the defensive. This is a positive development.\n2. Instead of talking about the \"massacre,\" Hamas focuses on the details of the \"massacre.\" In such a situation, the intensity of criticism of Israel is reduced. \"The issue is under investigation\" and not clear and absolute.\n3. When Israel counters Hamas's propaganda instead of observing from the sidelines, the situation improves slightly.\n\nAnd now to the main question that Israel should present to Hamas as part of the debate on the \"Massacre\":\nHamas claimed that 40 people were killed, and published a detailed lists of the names of 12 children. Hamas pretends to have extensive knowledge of the names of the casualties and the circumstances of their death. Why don't they publish the complete list of all 40 dead? Why hide? What about the other 10-11 militants? Why were they hiding in the school? Let's discuss all the names.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point, why doesn't Hamas publish the names of its military operatives who were killed in airstrikes? \n\nOne would think that the terrorist organization would pride itself in its \"martyrs\" - honor their dead, and publish the names of those killed in battle.  It appears that Hamas is more concerned about its public image. By not publishing these names, it maintains ambiguity with which it can accuse Israel of targeting civilians in schools / shelters / hospitals. \n\nEven Hezbollah does not behave this way. Hamas dishonors their dead just so it can lie and accuse Israel of war crimes.
