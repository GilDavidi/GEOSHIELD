strike inside Russia to counter coming Russian attacks in the Kharkov region, it has since used Western weapons to attack targets irrelevant to the special military operation.Over the past week, Ukraine claimed that it struck two Russian early warning radar systems designed to detect long-range ballistic missile attacks, including nuclear strikes.\nNeither system that was targeted was turned toward Ukrainian territory, which seems to implicate an alternative motive than affecting the Ukrainian theater.The attack represented a significant escalation of the conflict and came as NATO countries toyed with the idea of sending their troops to Ukraine to fill Kiev\u2019s manpower shortage.Since Russia has proven more than capable of defeating NATO equipment and tactics on the battlefield, it has little reason to fear a conventional land war against NATO countries in Ukraine, but that could easily spiral into a nuclear war which forces any rational actor to behave with caution.\u201cNATO representatives, especially in Europe, should be aware of what they are playing with,\u201d Putin said at a press conference in Uzbekistan on Tuesday.Western countries don\u2019t fear allowing Kiev to strike inside of Russia because they already have and those countries didn\u2019t suffer any significant consequences, noted Sleboda.On Wednesday, the Head of the Delegation of the Russian Federation to the Vienna Negotiations on Military Security and Arms Control, Konstantin Gavrilov warned that \u201cA potential aggressor needs to realize that, if attacked, we reserve the right to act \u2018as the situation demands,\u2019 so to speak, and use all our capabilities,\u201d adding that any response to violating Russian redlines \u201cmay be truly devastating.\u201dWith its numerous successes on the battlefield over the past several months Russia has no reason to seek escalation, but Western countries continue to try to provoke Russia into a wider war despite the consequences it could hold for all of civilization.A recent study by Nature estimated that a nuclear war between the United States and Russia would result in around 5 billion deaths worldwide.\nhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20240528/poland-not-excluding-sending-troops-to-ukraine-in-future---foreign-ministry-1118662023.htmlrussiaukrainekievSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com

entering Rafah would mark the final stage of its war against Hamas, which initiated attacks on Israel in October, resulting in approximately 1,200 casualties and the abduction of around 250

camp depicted scenes of horror, with charred bodies extracted from rubble and a man holding the headless body of a child amidst raging fires.Despite calls for reconsideration, US President Joe Biden has maintained his stance on Israel, indicating that the Rafah strike had not yet crossed a red line warranting alterations in American support.The strike occurred shortly after the International
