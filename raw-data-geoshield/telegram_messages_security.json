Also, Hamas demanded a Turkish guarantee in addition to the Egyptian and American guarantees, especially after the objection of the US to include Russia as a party to the agreement.\n\nThe newspaper also reported that Egypt is exerting significant pressure on Hamas because it believes that the American position is correct and that the US continues to exert pressure on Netanyahu's government in a way that causes problems within the Israeli government and even in the Israeli army, all while the US attempts to stop the ongoing wave of student protests - Something that has become a primary goal for the Biden administration.\n\nIn the same matter, Al-Akhbar notes that the mediators asked Hamas to give them more time before giving their answer, because they were convinced that Hamas's answer would be negative, which led to Egyptian-American-Israeli contacts to prevent the collapse of the talks in the last 48 hours. In this context, the newspaper noted that Egypt obtained an Israeli promise to postpone any action in Rafah at least until the end of next week.\n\nThe newspaper adds that the next few hours are critical in terms of reaching a deal."}, {"id": "106d62a7-40c4-4a96-9dd4-a96c0ac9adea", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26620/", "date": "2024-05-03 06:44", "message": "Last night's attack in Damascus, attributed to Israel\n\nSyrian sources identified with the Shiite axis report that the target of the Israeli attack in Damascus was the \"State Security School\" (of the Syrian Army - AA), near the village of Najaha, and as a result, a three-story building was severely damaged there.\nAccording to these sources, the target of the attack belonged to the Syrian army and not to Iranian elements in Syria.\n\nThe Syrian Ministry of Defense officially announced that Israel carried out an airstrike last night at 10:05 PM which resulted in the injury of 8 Syrian soldiers and damage to property."}]
