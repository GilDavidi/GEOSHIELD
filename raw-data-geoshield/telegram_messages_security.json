In this context, the newspaper noted that Egypt obtained an Israeli promise to postpone any action in Rafah at least until the end of next week.\n\nThe newspaper adds that the next few hours are critical in terms of reaching a deal."}, {"id": "17e48d0c-b896-4395-9897-72b6df6c8790", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26620/", "date": "2024-05-03 06:44", "message": "Last night's attack in Damascus, attributed to Israel\n\nSyrian sources identified with the Shiite axis report that the target of the Israeli attack in Damascus was the \"State Security School\" (of the Syrian Army - AA), near the village of Najaha, and as a result, a three-story building was severely damaged there.\nAccording to these sources, the target of the attack belonged to the Syrian army and not to Iranian elements in Syria.\n\nThe Syrian Ministry of Defense officially announced that Israel carried out an airstrike last night at 10:05 PM which resulted in the injury of 8 Syrian soldiers and damage to property."}, {"id": "a7f3aee2-3d43-47a6-906d-1a762b75374c", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26619/", "date": "2024-05-02 20:40", "message": "After the report of the Bloomberg agency's reporter in Turkey \ud83d\udc46, the Turkish Ministry of Commerce officially announces:\n\nFrom today, the import of goods from Israel and the export of goods to it will be suspended until all aid can be brought into the Gaza Strip"}, {"id": "e52e9a00-48cf-4a45-9748-d0cac8992ce9", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26618/", "date": "2024-05-02 20:19", "message": "Palestinian sources report the death of officer Muhammad Adas, one of the companions of Palestinian Authority Chairman Abu Mazen from the Presidential Guard, as a result of an IDF shot that hit him in the head during the entry of IDF forces into the village of Anbata in the Tulkarm district in the last hour."}, {"id": "61df6e67-5cf8-404e-adbb-76bf6ca1e48c", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26617/", "date": "2024-05-02 20:17", "message": "Sources associated with the Syrian opposition report on limited explosions heard in the last half hour in Damascus, the capital of Syria.\n\nAccording to these sources, the Syrian air defense systems were not activated.\n\nThe sources add that an Israeli airstrike was carried out against a military post near the fifth bridge on the road leading to the Damascus border."}, {"id": "b365a348-0245-4a3e-8ae5-65e03682592e", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26616/", "date": "2024-05-02 19:25", "message": "Following today's report on the death of Dr. Adnan Albarsh \ud83d\udc46 and another Gazan, in prison in Israel, Hamas, in an official announcement on its behalf, is trying to create symmetry with the Israeli abductees in Gaza and states that \"the death of two of our people abducted in the prison of the fascist occupation, under barbaric torture is proof of the heinous war crimes committed by the occupation.. \"\nHamas calls on the international community to act immediately and condemn \"this Nazi behavior and force Israel to reveal what happened to the thousands of Palestinians kidnapped by Israel and to return them to their families...\""}, {"id": "09b3503c-74d2-45ff-8e02-b53b0dd61f5b", "channel_id": 1560386984, "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26615/", "date": "2024-05-02 18:47", "message": "While the President of the United States finds it difficult to condemn anti-Semitism against the Jews and Israel, a close ally of the United States, the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott announces:\n\nAmerican Jewish Heritage Month\n\nAbbott tweets:\n\"I am proud to announce American Jewish Heritage Month in Texas.\nIt is necessary now, more than ever, that we stand in solidarity with Israel and the Jewish community.\nWe will always support Israel and celebrate the role played by American Jews in our great country.\"\n\nShow him some love in the comments on Twitter.
