Israel \"in response to the horrific crime that the Israeli enemy committed in Mais al-Jabal\".The Lebanese movement has repeatedly declared that only a ceasefire in Gaza will put an end to its attacks on Israel, which it says are in support of Gazans and its ally Hamas.Both the United States and France have made diplomatic efforts to calm tensions on the Lebanese-Israeli border.In Lebanon, at least 390 people have been killed in nearly seven months of cross-border violence, mostly militants but also more than 70 civilians, according to an AFP tally.Israel says 11 soldiers and nine civilians have been killed on its side of the border.Tens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides."}, {"id": "597058de-fa1b-4448-82d5-3be4ccc628ec", "title": "Four Lebanese civilians
