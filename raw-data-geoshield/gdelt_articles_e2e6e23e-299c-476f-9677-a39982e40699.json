Jake Auchincloss (D-MA) said during a televised interview that cutting federal funding to Harvard should be \u201con the table\u201d in response to what he claims is antisemitism on the campus of the Ivy League school.The comments come as Pro-Palestine protests have sprung up at college campuses across the Nation, including Harvard and other Ivy League schools.More than 70% of Democrats and 61% of all Americans support a permanent ceasefire in Gaza andTo support his assertion, Auchincloss pointed to the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s (ADL) Campus Antisemitism Report Card which gave Harvard and 12 other top schools failing grades, judging them on three main criteria: \u201cJewish life on campus,\u201d \u201cincidents on campus\u201d and \u201cadministrative actions and policies.\u201dHarvard\u2019s report notes that it has a high Jewish student population, extensive Jewish groups and support for Religious activities, Kosher dining and an official anti-boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) policy.The university nevertheless received an F from the ADL for what it describes as \u201chigh\u201d levels of \u201cSevere antisemitic and anti-Zionist incidents,\u201d \u201cOther antisemitic and anti-Zionist incidents,\u201d \u201cHostile anti-Zionist student government activity,\u201d \u201cHostile anti-Zionist groups\u201d and \u201cAntisemitic speakers or programs on campus.\u201dIt did not mention which groups or speakers it considered antisemitic.The ADL\u2019s report card of the school focuses almost entirely on anti-Zionist and Pro-Palestinian protests, referencing both an April 2022 protest against an event that included Israel\u2019s ambassador to the US Michael Herzog, as well as protests opposing Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza.It also mentions the tearing down of posters depicting Israeli hostages and a 1960s political cartoon published by a Palestinian student group that the ADL said was antisemitic.The protests at Harvard included many Jewish students and the Jewish Voice for Peace has been one of the principal organizers of the protests.\nLast week, the students agreed to end their protest after agreeing with the school\u2019s administration to have a meeting addressing the student\u2019s demands.Since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, during which roughly 1,000 Israelis were killed, more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 13,000 children.\nhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20240518/israeli-political-crisis-deepens-as-idf-failures-prompt-cabinet-resignation-threat-1118521853.htmlisraelpalestineSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 602024Ian DeMartinoIan DeMartinoNewsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA \u201eRosiya Segodnya\u201c 252 60Ian DeMartinoantisemitism on campus, harvard protests, jake auchincloss"}, {"id": "c1f89816-a9d5-4a6e-bd36-353b8e4e23e5", "title": "What it means to be brave today for Jews and Israelis -
