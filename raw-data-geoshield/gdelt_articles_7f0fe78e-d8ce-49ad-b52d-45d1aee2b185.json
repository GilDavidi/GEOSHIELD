problems.\nAfter their experience living through Hurricane Floyd in 1999, every time there\u2019s a storm, they get nervous about its impact on their Edgecombe County home.\n\u201cI think, \u2018Oh lord, it\u2019s going to happen again,\u2019 but the water rises and nobody comes out to check on us.\u201dAfter Debby made landfall in Eastern Carolina Thursday, the Tar River\u2019s water levels have risen and flooded over many properties and roads.\nThe roads are back open, but resident Dylan Everette lives off of Highway 111 and says as the river levels go up, flooding could happen in the area again.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a little bit worried about what\u2019s going to come next.\u201dThe National Weather Service has issued a flood warning for Edgecombe County until further notice."},
