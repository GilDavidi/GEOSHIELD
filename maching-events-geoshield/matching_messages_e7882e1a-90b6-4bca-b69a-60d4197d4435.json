Only the release of the hostages?\u00a0\nWhy is Hamas's list so long and marketed so well? Each such demand line from Hamas is published and reiterated non-stop by officials and representatives, which only strengthens each of the demands individually as bargaining chips in the negotiations. Israel has to give something to meet each of Hamas's long list of demands.\n\nDoes Israel only want the release of hostages? That's it? Why?\n\nOver the past few months, the US has been urging Israel to make decisions on \"the day after the war.\" This was crucial to them. Israel was publicly reprimanded, even creating internal political conflict.\n\nNow, the time has come for Israel to turn to the Americans, who are urging it with all their might to reach an agreement and ask about the day after the war.\n\nWhat will happen to senior Hamas officials? What will happen to Hamas's weapons?\n\nJust as Hamas announces several times a day in every possible media outlet that its threshold condition for a deal is a permanent ceasefire, Israel should now demand as a threshold condition for any future agreement the removal of senior Hamas officials from the Strip and the disarmament of Hamas.\n\nThis is a logical, basic, important condition, one that the US will have a hard time saying no to, which can lead to the full and real end of the war, even if the IDF does not eliminate all of Hamas's militants in the Strip (complete elimination is probably an unrealistic goal).\n\nSuch a condition would prevent Hamas from claiming victory. The winners are never exiled.\n\nThe US can and should agree to such a condition - it will allow it to create new leadership in Gaza for the day after the war. As long as senior Hamas officials are not expelled from the Strip and as long as Hamas is not disarmed, it is irrelevant to talk about \"the day after\" in the Strip.\n\nHamas will not just peacefully allow a foreign power (Israel, the US, Saudi Arabia, or anyone else...) to replace them as the ruling force in the Gaza Strip with someone else. The exile of Hamas's leaders is a necessary step, as mentioned, towards ending the war.\n\nIsrael should start demanding that the exile of Hamas and its disarmament are threshold conditions for any future ceasefire deal! Only then can we commit to ending the war, and it would even help Biden reach a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia before the November elections...", "url": "https://abualiexpress.com/en/en26854/", "date": "2024-05-07 12:34", "source": "Telegram"}], "location": "", "total_score": 0, "count": 1, "average_score": 0.0, "final_score": 0.0}, "0f9cfea3-d601-4db1-b8ad-2691d60dd372": {"messages": [{"id": "0f9cfea3-d601-4db1-b8ad-2691d60dd372", "message": "The Egyptian Foreign Ministry condemns the operation in Rafah.

After all, we're not really doing anything to prevent you from doing so, but we still need to maintain our image as one of the leading countries in the Arab world...\n\nThe al-Sisi regime, which despises the Muslim Brotherhood and its Palestinian branch - Hamas, would be more than happy to see Hamas disappear from its border.\n\nMeanwhile, there are quite a few complaints among Gazans on social media: Where has the Egyptian army gone? They're doing nothing to prevent Israel from acting in Rafah...\n\n##\nTo summarize,\u00a0the Egyptians are not that excited,\u00a0and\u00a0Hamas has not stopped the ceasefire talks.\u00a0Now we
