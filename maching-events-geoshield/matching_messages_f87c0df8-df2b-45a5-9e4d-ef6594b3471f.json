refuge.\nWe've seen the claims that 14 children were killed in this strike.\nAnd certainly when you see -- if that is accurate that 14 children were killed, those aren't terrorists.\nIsrael often names militants it has \"eliminated\" but the United States almost never pushes it to do so.", "url":

Israeli attack on a UN school complex in central Gaza is raising alarm among U.S. officials after scores of civilians were reportedly killed, despite the apparent use of American-made precision munitions.\nIn both that attack and Thursday\u2019s strike on the school, weapons experts tell ABC News that fragments at the sites indicate that American-supplied munitions \u2014 GBU-39 small diameter bombs \u2014 were used.\nThrough the conflict, Israel has not made a consistent practice of sharing intelligence justifying its attacks with its allies or the public.\nBut Palestinians in Gaza say the end result is that they are left with no refuge from the horrors of war.\n\u201cBut this is what happened.\u201dABC News\u2019 Diaa Ostaz, Morgan Winsor, Helena Skinner and Chris Looft
