distinguish between civilians and fighters in their Gaza Strip military campaign, the United Nations human rights office said on Wednesday.\nIn a report assessing six Israeli attacks that caused a high number of casualties and destruction of civilian infrastructure, the U.N. human rights office (OHCHR) said Israeli forces \"may have systematically violated the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions in attack.\"\n\"We call first on the Israeli authorities to take steps to ensure that proper investigations, transparent investigations are held.\"\nShe added that, in the absence of transparent investigations, there would be \"a need for international action in this regard as well.\"\nLast week the U.N. human rights office said the killing of civilians during an Israeli operation to free four hostages could amount to war crimes, but so might Palestinian militants' holding of captives in densely populated areas.", "url":
